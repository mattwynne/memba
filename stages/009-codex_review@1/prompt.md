  Reviewed local HTML accompanies these plans:
  
  - `design-system/templates/club-groups.html`: final rail and shared group frame.
  - `design-system/templates/club-group-non-member.html`: regular non-member and outside-admin views.
  - `design-system/explorations/custom-groups-prototype.html`: interactive final behaviour.
  
  Omit creation, membership mutation and Request access controls until their slices. Regular non-members see the group name and Admin contact, not member counts, group email, conversation previews/activity or member names. Outside admins can see membership metadata. These are the reviewed prototype's presentation choices, not new public-reading grants.
  
  Use `MemberDashboardGroupTabs.group_tabs/1` for the single active-tab action position; group headers contain metadata only. Reuse `Layouts.club_site`, `MemberComponents` rows and the current Canada/open-source footer. The local designs were browser-rendered; cloud DesignSync remains unsynchronised. Existing local sources are sufficient for implementation; do not invent a replacement design.
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  
  - All active club members see all current-club group names; visibility never widens to another club or signed-out visitors.
  - A regular non-member opening a group gets access guidance, not not-found, but receives no private rows even in initial render, LiveView diffs or direct data/action requests.
  - A club admin outside a custom group sees only its Members surface, with no conversation content, compose action or implicit email membership.
  - Direct conversation/detail/reply/follow/delivery routes still require actual effective conversation access.
  - Valid explicitly selected groups, including non-member placeholders, remain selected. A remembered existing same-club group opens its current permitted surface; missing/foreign selections fall back to Everyone. No membership or access is inferred from browser storage.
  - Existing system-group membership and last-Admin rules are unchanged.
  
  ## Open Business Decisions
  
  None known. Matt approved the email-only placeholder until 065 and the prototype's access distinctions.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Separate discovery from participation in the Membership public query API. Add a club-scoped discovery summary for an authenticated active club member. Preserve `list_active_groups_for_member/2` as the actual-membership API: Messaging uses it for access, so broadening it would expose conversations.
  2. Update `MemberDashboardPresentation` to resolve group identity within the authorised club, then load only the permitted surface. Explicitly distinguish ordinary non-member, outside admin and participating member. Do not fetch private message/member rows and merely hide them in HEEx.
  3. Extend the existing stateless tabs/frame/list composition in `page_html/club.html.heex` and `member_dashboard_group_tabs.ex`. Keep one contextual action slot, correct tab/panel ARIA and keyboard behaviour. Do not restore the removed single-member promotional blank slate.
  4. Preserve selected-group routing and remembered selection through `MemberDashboardLive` and its existing browser hook. Refresh discovery/access state on relevant read-model changes; reject direct actions after access loss. Keep conversation access in public Membership/Messaging APIs, not projection joins in the web layer.
  5. Implement the tagged domain/browser examples and focused presentation, component and routed LiveView regressions. Verify no disclosure on guessed URLs, cross-club IDs or stale browser state; run `dev check` on the exact delivered state.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  None expected to block implementation. Use opaque existing group IDs and existing club-host/query routing helpers. Keep read-model changes and privacy decisions server-authoritative. No new aggregate or generic permission framework is needed.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Members can find a group's name and know how to ask for access. Club admins can inspect who belongs without subscribing to conversations.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Parse shared Gherkin and confirm runner-debt exclusions while planning.
  - Test discovery separately from conversation access, including direct URLs and already-open LiveView updates.
  - Run both runners' new scenarios as their implementation lands and retain existing 058/system-group regressions. Update the historical 058 scenario-inventory assertion in `acceptance-tests/test/cucumber_config.test.js` to recognize scenarios evolving in later iterations without losing provenance or hiding runnable regressions.
  - Manually review Eve's email-only placeholder and Dan's Members-only view on desktop/mobile.
  - Run `dev check` for delivery and report its exact checked commit/state.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  The highest risk is reusing the new discovery list as a conversation access grant. Keep the existing active-membership query separate. Do not turn metadata visibility into access to conversation subject lines or member lists. Request access is intentionally absent until 065; membership actions arrive in 063–064. No problem-note status updates, app-wide error redesign or unrelated refactor belongs here.

You are independently reviewing the completed, plan-conforming implementation of the iteration plan at docs/iterations/061-discover-club-groups/plan.md.

Use the prior context: the plan text, collected implementation evidence, current working tree state, commit range from `ced78e9caccb5eb5ab2b374024bcbd3b47f3cd8f..HEAD`, and the successful dev check output. Be strict, practical, and specific. Do not edit files.

This workflow reviews an already-committed implementation after the implementation workflow has proved plan conformance. The review job is code polish plus smell radar: refactoring, maintainability, project conventions, ADR conformance, and surfacing judgement-worthy non-blocking smells. Do not emit shell-command/tool-call JSON; return the Markdown review report only.

Use the project pattern reference docs as review guidelines when the touched code involves domain modeling, Commanded, aggregates, projections, event streams, read models, or object responsibility boundaries:

- `docs/reference/domain-driven-design.md`
- `docs/reference/cqrs.md`
- `docs/reference/event-sourcing.md`
- `docs/reference/responsibility-driven-design.md`

Treat accepted ADRs as binding project decisions. Treat these reference docs as design-quality guidance for interpreting and applying those ADRs, not as permission to override an ADR or the iteration plan.

Automated tests are the behavioural feedback loop in this workflow. If you find a likely behavioural gap, missing acceptance criterion, or inadequate automated coverage despite green dev check, flag it as a blocking issue requiring a new implementation/test pass or human decision; do not disguise it as refactoring feedback. Do not ask for feature-file edits.

Review against these questions:

0. ADR conformance
   - Read every ADR cited by the plan and any nearby/current ADRs under `docs/adr/` that govern touched architecture.
   - Follow signposts in those ADRs to the reference docs above; use them to check whether domain/CQRS/event-sourcing/RDD implementation choices match the patterns Memba wants.
   - Does the implementation obey accepted ADR decisions and consequences as binding constraints?
   - Does it avoid replacing ADR-mandated infrastructure or architecture with simpler local substitutes, unless the plan explicitly deferred that decision?
   - Do tests and implementation evidence prove the ADR-relevant behaviour, wiring, or structure?
   - Reject if the implementation conflicts with accepted ADRs or omits a cited ADR's central decision without an explicit plan deferral or human decision.

1. Light plan-fidelity sanity check
   - Does the implementation appear consistent with the stated goal and capability, given the plan-conformance gate has already passed?
   - Did it avoid obvious out-of-scope work?
   - If you find a substantial plan gap, classify it as blocking and requiring human input or a new implementation pass.

2. Behaviour and automated coverage
   - Did dev check pass before review?
   - Are important happy paths, edge cases, permissions, error states, and data/state changes covered by automated tests where appropriate?
   - Were acceptance feature files left unchanged as domain acceptance criteria?

3. Technical quality / refactoring
   - Are Phoenix, LiveView, HEEx, Ecto, Tailwind, and Elixir conventions followed where relevant?
   - Are migrations, schemas, contexts, tests, routes, UI, background jobs, and integrations coherent?
   - Is the implementation maintainable, minimal, and well factored?

4. Code-health classification
   - Blocking: ADR violations, behavioural gaps, missing or unsafe coverage, repeated blockers, or anything needing product/architecture judgement before merge.
   - Bounded-safe: concrete, low-risk refactoring, maintainability, convention, or test-quality fixes an agent can apply without changing product behaviour or feature files.
   - Judgement-worthy non-blocking: design smells, coupling, duplication, naming, dependency, or architecture drift that might merit human judgement later but should not block this merge.
