  12. Add/adjust a test that every `club_site` surface still renders under the new shell (club home,
      conversation, compose, invitation, public club page).
  13. Run `./bin/dev gallery-walk` and compare the club-home and conversation screenshots to
      `design-system/wireframes/club-home.html` / `member-conversation.html`.
  14. Run `dev check` and confirm it is green (no feature-file changes).
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  None open — both prior technical questions are decided in the Implementation Plan:
  
  - **CSS source: decided — port the DS component classes** (`app-frame`, `app-card`, `app-bar` &
    children, `app-menu`, `app-foot`, identity-dropdown pieces) verbatim from `design-system/`
    (`memba.css` / `styles.css`) into `web/assets/css/app.css`, keeping class names 1:1 with the
    design mirror rather than re-expressing the shell in Tailwind utilities. This keeps the design
    mirror authoritative and the app pixel-faithful.
  - **Identity name/initials plumbing: decided — a new optional `member_name` assign** on
    `club_site`, passed by the four signed-in member surfaces, with an email-local-part fallback and
    a `Layouts.initials/1` helper for the avatar. The signed-out public page supplies neither
    identity nor name (dropdown gated off).
  
  ## New Capability
  
  A shared, app-like **shell** (app-bar + app-card) across every member surface — built once in the
  shared layout — so the club-home tabs and the aligned conversation page can be built inside a
  consistent frame instead of each screen re-inventing its own header.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - **Automated:** LiveView/layout tests (app-bar renders the club name; identity dropdown gated on
    identity; Sign out posts to `DELETE /auth`; app-card wraps content; every `club_site` surface
    renders). `dev check` green (no feature-file changes).
  - **Visual:** `./bin/dev gallery-walk`, then compare the club-home and conversation screenshots to
    `design-system/wireframes/club-home.html` / `member-conversation.html` (app-bar + app-card + the
    "Powered by Memba" foot).
  - **Manual:** signed-in club home + conversation show the app-bar; the identity dropdown opens and
    Sign out works; the public club page shows the app-bar with no identity dropdown.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - **Shared-layout blast radius:** changing `club_site` touches all six surfaces — verify the public
    club page (signed out), compose, invitation, and message detail all still render.
  - **CSS porting:** the app-shell component classes must be added to the app stylesheet; keep them
    named 1:1 with the design mirror.
  - **Follow-on slices (my own sequencing, not bound to the old 044/045/046 drafts):** (1) club-home
    Conversations / Members / **About** tabs inside this shell; (2) conversation-page content
    alignment (compact delivery, follow toggle, replies-first + "Replies · N", message timestamps);
    (3) member names + role badges (needs role data in the read model). Each is its own later slice.
  - **Numbering:** delivered as iteration 044 so Fabro's "earlier iterations merged first" rule is
    satisfied (001–043 are merged). The unmerged 045/046 drafts are left untouched and will be
    re-decided when their turn comes.

You are independently reviewing the completed, plan-conforming implementation of the iteration plan at docs/iterations/044-shared-app-shell/plan.md.

Use the prior context: the plan text, collected implementation evidence, current working tree state, commit range from `e0fb9401c0e88b3388bf1a2f847acdb7be0b7e55..HEAD`, and the successful dev check output. Be strict, practical, and specific. Do not edit files.

This workflow reviews an already-committed implementation after the implementation workflow has proved plan conformance. The review job is code polish plus smell radar: refactoring, maintainability, project conventions, ADR conformance, and surfacing judgement-worthy non-blocking smells. Do not emit shell-command/tool-call JSON; return the Markdown review report only.

Use the project pattern reference docs as review guidelines when the touched code involves domain modeling, Commanded, aggregates, projections, event streams, read models, or object responsibility boundaries:

- `docs/reference/domain-driven-design.md`
- `docs/reference/cqrs.md`
- `docs/reference/event-sourcing.md`
- `docs/reference/responsibility-driven-design.md`

Treat accepted ADRs as binding project decisions. Treat these reference docs as design-quality guidance for interpreting and applying those ADRs, not as permission to override an ADR or the iteration plan.

Automated tests are the behavioural feedback loop in this workflow. If you find a likely behavioural gap, missing acceptance criterion, or inadequate automated coverage despite green dev check, flag it as a blocking issue requiring a new implementation/test pass or human decision; do not disguise it as refactoring feedback. Do not ask for feature-file edits.

Review against these questions:

0. ADR conformance
   - Read every ADR cited by the plan and any nearby/current ADRs under `docs/adr/` that govern touched architecture.
   - Follow signposts in those ADRs to the reference docs above; use them to check whether domain/CQRS/event-sourcing/RDD implementation choices match the patterns Memba wants.
   - Does the implementation obey accepted ADR decisions and consequences as binding constraints?
   - Does it avoid replacing ADR-mandated infrastructure or architecture with simpler local substitutes, unless the plan explicitly deferred that decision?
   - Do tests and implementation evidence prove the ADR-relevant behaviour, wiring, or structure?
   - Reject if the implementation conflicts with accepted ADRs or omits a cited ADR's central decision without an explicit plan deferral or human decision.

1. Light plan-fidelity sanity check
   - Does the implementation appear consistent with the stated goal and capability, given the plan-conformance gate has already passed?
   - Did it avoid obvious out-of-scope work?
   - If you find a substantial plan gap, classify it as blocking and requiring human input or a new implementation pass.

2. Behaviour and automated coverage
   - Did dev check pass before review?
   - Are important happy paths, edge cases, permissions, error states, and data/state changes covered by automated tests where appropriate?
   - Were acceptance feature files left unchanged as domain acceptance criteria?

3. Technical quality / refactoring
   - Are Phoenix, LiveView, HEEx, Ecto, Tailwind, and Elixir conventions followed where relevant?
   - Are migrations, schemas, contexts, tests, routes, UI, background jobs, and integrations coherent?
   - Is the implementation maintainable, minimal, and well factored?

4. Code-health classification
   - Blocking: ADR violations, behavioural gaps, missing or unsafe coverage, repeated blockers, or anything needing product/architecture judgement before merge.
   - Bounded-safe: concrete, low-risk refactoring, maintainability, convention, or test-quality fixes an agent can apply without changing product behaviour or feature files.
   - Judgement-worthy non-blocking: design smells, coupling, duplication, naming, dependency, or architecture drift that might merit human judgement later but should not block this merge.

Return a Markdown report with:

- Decision: ACCEPT or REJECT
- Confidence: High, Medium, or Low
- ADR conformance: PASS or FAIL
- ADR violations: numbered list with ADR number/file and implementation evidence
- Blocking issues: numbered list
- Bounded-safe fixes: numbered list
- Judgement-worthy non-blocking code-health findings: numbered list; for each include file(s), smell, and why it may need human judgement
- Suggested fixes: concrete changes if rejected or bounded-safe fixes exist
- Validation notes: tests/checks/manual checks relevant to the decision
