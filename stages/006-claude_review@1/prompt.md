  - New DS previews exist in the repo for: invite-a-member (member-admin + staff variants), profile completion, and check-email with delivery-progress states.
  - The badges component card includes the role / Membership-Admin chips matching how they render in the app.
  - Every preview is self-contained: daisyUI prebuilt CSS via CDN + the app theme as `:root` vars + plain CSS for layout; it does **not** rely on Tailwind utility classes and does **not** link the bespoke shared component CSS.
  - Each preview carries its `@dsCard` header so the DS pane indexes it, and uses correct relative asset paths.
  - Each preview renders cleanly under headless Chrome (no broken/unstyled components) and visually matches the corresponding shipped surface.
  - No app code, routes, LiveViews, templates, or `.feature` files are changed.
  - `dev check` passes (static preview files do not affect the app build or tests).
  
  ## Open Business Decisions
  
  None known. The surfaces already exist in the product; this documents them in the DS.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Read the shipped surfaces to mirror them accurately: `member_invitation_live/new.ex`, `admin/club_member_invitations_live/`, `club_member_invitation_html/profile.html.heex`, and `auth_live/sign_in.ex`; note the real fields, states, copy, and delivery-progress states.
  2. Confirm the repo preview location and the self-contained head block (daisyUI CDN + theme `:root` vars from `web/assets/css/app.css` + needed raw tokens), reusing the phase-2 convention and class-mapping cheat sheet.
  3. Author the invite-a-member preview (member-admin + staff variants).
  4. Author the profile-completion preview.
  5. Author the check-email / delivery-progress preview, covering the progress states.
  6. Extend the badges card with the role / Membership-Admin chips.
  7. Render-verify each file with headless Chrome; fix any unstyled/broken components (watch for accidental Tailwind utility usage that won't resolve statically).
  8. Ensure `@dsCard` headers and relative asset paths are correct on every new/changed file.
  9. Run `dev check` to confirm the static files leave the build green.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  - **Repo preview location.** Preferred: a `design-system/` mirror directory whose paths match the cloud DS (e.g. `design-system/wireframes/*.html`, `design-system/components/badges/badges.card.html`) so the eventual DesignSync push is a clean directory-to-project sync. Acceptable fallback: continue authoring under `spikes/ds-convert/` as the convergence work did. Choose one and keep it consistent; record the mapping so the PM push step is mechanical.
  - **One file vs two for the invite variants** — member-admin and staff invites in a single preview with both states, or two sibling files. Implementer's call based on which renders clearer.
  - Exact cloud DS target paths for each new file (decided at push time by the PM, guided by the repo mapping above).
  
  These are implementation details and should not need product decisions.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  The design system shows how member invitations, profile completion, and the sign-in check-email/delivery-progress surface actually look and work, instead of omitting them — closing the first slice of the gap between shipped features and the DS, and giving future design iteration a faithful starting point for these surfaces.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Headless-Chrome render screenshots of each new/changed preview, visually compared to the running app surface.
  - Confirm no app code, routes, templates, or `.feature` files changed (diff is preview files only).
  - `dev check` green.
  - **Post-merge PM step (manual, outside Fabro):** push the approved preview files to the cloud DS project `bc97cfc3-436c-471e-a939-7ba222859282` via DesignSync, then visually confirm the new cards render in claude.ai/design. This step is required to "bring the DS up to speed" but cannot run inside Fabro.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - **Tailwind-utility trap:** static prebuilt-daisyUI previews silently drop Tailwind utility classes, producing broken renders. Mitigation: daisyUI components + plain CSS only, and mandatory headless-Chrome render verification on every file.
  - **Fidelity drift:** the design must reflect what shipped, not an idealized version. Mitigation: implementer reads the actual LiveViews/templates first; PM compares renders to the live app before pushing.
  - **Fabro cannot push to the cloud DS.** The iteration only produces repo files; the cloud push is a separate manual PM step. The iteration is not "done" for the stated goal until that push happens, but the push is deliberately out of the Fabro slice.
  - **WIP ordering:** this plan can be validated now but cannot deliver until iterations 034 (and then 035) vacate the single implementation WIP slot.
  - **Deferred slices:** onboarding-requests previews and empty-states/refresh remain follow-up DS-catch-up iterations.

You are independently reviewing the completed, plan-conforming implementation of the iteration plan at docs/iterations/036-ds-catchup-member-management-and-auth/plan.md.

Use the prior context: the plan text, collected implementation evidence, current working tree state, commit range from `9d699054c173f9dc30454056a03230357a6a1d38..HEAD`, and the successful dev check output. Be strict, practical, and specific. Do not edit files.

This workflow reviews an already-committed implementation after the implementation workflow has proved plan conformance. The review job is code polish plus smell radar: refactoring, maintainability, project conventions, ADR conformance, and surfacing judgement-worthy non-blocking smells. Do not emit shell-command/tool-call JSON; return the Markdown review report only.

Use the project pattern reference docs as review guidelines when the touched code involves domain modeling, Commanded, aggregates, projections, event streams, read models, or object responsibility boundaries:

- `docs/reference/domain-driven-design.md`
- `docs/reference/cqrs.md`
- `docs/reference/event-sourcing.md`
- `docs/reference/responsibility-driven-design.md`

Treat accepted ADRs as binding project decisions. Treat these reference docs as design-quality guidance for interpreting and applying those ADRs, not as permission to override an ADR or the iteration plan.

Automated tests are the behavioural feedback loop in this workflow. If you find a likely behavioural gap, missing acceptance criterion, or inadequate automated coverage despite green dev check, flag it as a blocking issue requiring a new implementation/test pass or human decision; do not disguise it as refactoring feedback. Do not ask for feature-file edits.

Review against these questions:

0. ADR conformance
   - Read every ADR cited by the plan and any nearby/current ADRs under `docs/adr/` that govern touched architecture.
   - Follow signposts in those ADRs to the reference docs above; use them to check whether domain/CQRS/event-sourcing/RDD implementation choices match the patterns Memba wants.
   - Does the implementation obey accepted ADR decisions and consequences as binding constraints?
   - Does it avoid replacing ADR-mandated infrastructure or architecture with simpler local substitutes, unless the plan explicitly deferred that decision?
   - Do tests and implementation evidence prove the ADR-relevant behaviour, wiring, or structure?
   - Reject if the implementation conflicts with accepted ADRs or omits a cited ADR's central decision without an explicit plan deferral or human decision.

1. Light plan-fidelity sanity check
   - Does the implementation appear consistent with the stated goal and capability, given the plan-conformance gate has already passed?
   - Did it avoid obvious out-of-scope work?
   - If you find a substantial plan gap, classify it as blocking and requiring human input or a new implementation pass.

2. Behaviour and automated coverage
   - Did dev check pass before review?
   - Are important happy paths, edge cases, permissions, error states, and data/state changes covered by automated tests where appropriate?
   - Were acceptance feature files left unchanged as domain acceptance criteria?

3. Technical quality / refactoring
   - Are Phoenix, LiveView, HEEx, Ecto, Tailwind, and Elixir conventions followed where relevant?
   - Are migrations, schemas, contexts, tests, routes, UI, background jobs, and integrations coherent?
   - Is the implementation maintainable, minimal, and well factored?

4. Code-health classification
   - Blocking: ADR violations, behavioural gaps, missing or unsafe coverage, repeated blockers, or anything needing product/architecture judgement before merge.
   - Bounded-safe: concrete, low-risk refactoring, maintainability, convention, or test-quality fixes an agent can apply without changing product behaviour or feature files.
   - Judgement-worthy non-blocking: design smells, coupling, duplication, naming, dependency, or architecture drift that might merit human judgement later but should not block this merge.
