  - The Members tab shows a **list of named member rows** (avatar initials + name), one per member,
    instead of the avatar-stack card.
  - The **current member's** row is marked (e.g. "You" in the meta).
  - The **Invite member** action (gated as today) and the members empty state are preserved.
  - **No change** to who appears in the member list or who can invite.
  
  ## Open Business Decisions
  
  None open. Role badges are deferred to 049 (which resolves which roles display).
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. In the Members `section-panel` of `web/lib/memba_web/controllers/page_html/club.html.heex`
     (added in 045), replace the avatar-stack card with a `member-list` container.
  2. Render each of `@members` as a `member-row`: avatar initials + the member's name.
  3. Add a meta line per row and mark the **current member** with a "You" indicator.
  4. Preserve the existing members **empty state** and the **Invite member** action from 045.
  5. Port the `member-list` and `member-row` CSS (and its children) from `design-system/`
     (`memba.css` / `styles.css`) into `web/assets/css/app.css`, names 1:1 with the mirror.
  6. Update the LiveView/controller test: members render as named rows; the current member's row is
     marked "You"; the Invite action and empty state still behave as before.
  7. Run `./bin/dev gallery-walk` and compare the Members tab to `club-home.html` (named rows).
  8. Run `dev check` and confirm it is green (no feature-file changes).
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  - **"Member since" date:** include the date in the row meta **only if** a membership-since date
    already flows to `@members` via `MemberDashboardPresentation`; if it does not, omit the date this
    slice (name + "You" marker only) rather than adding a new read-model field. Sourcing a
    membership-since date is a separate concern.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  The Members tab lists members by **name** (people, not avatars) — the base the role-badges slice
  (049) extends.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - **Automated:** LiveView/controller test (named rows; "You" marker; invite gating; empty state);
    `dev check` green.
  - **Visual:** `./bin/dev gallery-walk`; compare the Members tab to `club-home.html`.
  - **Manual:** open the club home Members tab; see named rows with your own row marked "You".
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Depends on 044 (shell) and 045 (Members tab) being merged first.
  - **049 role badges** adds per-member role badges once the product decision on which roles display
    is made (all assigned roles? committee roles only? exclude internal permission roles?).
  - Long member lists (e.g. 142 rows) render as a simple list; virtualisation/pagination is not in
    scope and can be a later concern if needed.

You are independently reviewing the completed, plan-conforming implementation of the iteration plan at docs/iterations/048-named-member-rows/plan.md.

Use the prior context: the plan text, collected implementation evidence, current working tree state, commit range from `dd82646f511e121c05ad004631f7e8ab87555043..HEAD`, and the successful dev check output. Be strict, practical, and specific. Do not edit files.

This workflow reviews an already-committed implementation after the implementation workflow has proved plan conformance. The review job is code polish plus smell radar: refactoring, maintainability, project conventions, ADR conformance, and surfacing judgement-worthy non-blocking smells. Do not emit shell-command/tool-call JSON; return the Markdown review report only.

Use the project pattern reference docs as review guidelines when the touched code involves domain modeling, Commanded, aggregates, projections, event streams, read models, or object responsibility boundaries:

- `docs/reference/domain-driven-design.md`
- `docs/reference/cqrs.md`
- `docs/reference/event-sourcing.md`
- `docs/reference/responsibility-driven-design.md`

Treat accepted ADRs as binding project decisions. Treat these reference docs as design-quality guidance for interpreting and applying those ADRs, not as permission to override an ADR or the iteration plan.

Automated tests are the behavioural feedback loop in this workflow. If you find a likely behavioural gap, missing acceptance criterion, or inadequate automated coverage despite green dev check, flag it as a blocking issue requiring a new implementation/test pass or human decision; do not disguise it as refactoring feedback. Do not ask for feature-file edits.

Review against these questions:

0. ADR conformance
   - Read every ADR cited by the plan and any nearby/current ADRs under `docs/adr/` that govern touched architecture.
   - Follow signposts in those ADRs to the reference docs above; use them to check whether domain/CQRS/event-sourcing/RDD implementation choices match the patterns Memba wants.
   - Does the implementation obey accepted ADR decisions and consequences as binding constraints?
   - Does it avoid replacing ADR-mandated infrastructure or architecture with simpler local substitutes, unless the plan explicitly deferred that decision?
   - Do tests and implementation evidence prove the ADR-relevant behaviour, wiring, or structure?
   - Reject if the implementation conflicts with accepted ADRs or omits a cited ADR's central decision without an explicit plan deferral or human decision.

1. Light plan-fidelity sanity check
   - Does the implementation appear consistent with the stated goal and capability, given the plan-conformance gate has already passed?
   - Did it avoid obvious out-of-scope work?
   - If you find a substantial plan gap, classify it as blocking and requiring human input or a new implementation pass.

2. Behaviour and automated coverage
   - Did dev check pass before review?
   - Are important happy paths, edge cases, permissions, error states, and data/state changes covered by automated tests where appropriate?
   - Were acceptance feature files left unchanged as domain acceptance criteria?

3. Technical quality / refactoring
   - Are Phoenix, LiveView, HEEx, Ecto, Tailwind, and Elixir conventions followed where relevant?
   - Are migrations, schemas, contexts, tests, routes, UI, background jobs, and integrations coherent?
   - Is the implementation maintainable, minimal, and well factored?

4. Code-health classification
   - Blocking: ADR violations, behavioural gaps, missing or unsafe coverage, repeated blockers, or anything needing product/architecture judgement before merge.
   - Bounded-safe: concrete, low-risk refactoring, maintainability, convention, or test-quality fixes an agent can apply without changing product behaviour or feature files.
   - Judgement-worthy non-blocking: design smells, coupling, duplication, naming, dependency, or architecture drift that might merit human judgement later but should not block this merge.

Return a Markdown report with:

- Decision: ACCEPT or REJECT
- Confidence: High, Medium, or Low
- ADR conformance: PASS or FAIL
- ADR violations: numbered list with ADR number/file and implementation evidence
- Blocking issues: numbered list
- Bounded-safe fixes: numbered list
- Judgement-worthy non-blocking code-health findings: numbered list; for each include file(s), smell, and why it may need human judgement
- Suggested fixes: concrete changes if rejected or bounded-safe fixes exist
- Validation notes: tests/checks/manual checks relevant to the decision
