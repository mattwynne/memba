  - Verification creates a signed-in identity/account session but not a Membership Person.
  - Name, club name, and note are collected after email verification for identities without a Person.
  - Staff only see and receive notifications for verified submitted requests.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Inspect the current `/get-started` controller/templates or LiveView, auth sign-in token creation, return-to handling, Staff request inbox, and onboarding request creation/notification code.
  2. Split the public Get Started experience into two states:
     - signed-out: email-only verification request;
     - signed-in: verified request form.
  3. Reuse the existing magic-link sign-in flow for the signed-out email-only step, setting return-to back to the Get Started request form.
  4. Ensure following the magic link returns the requester to Get Started and assigns `current_identity` for the verified email.
  5. Update request form rendering:
     - if signed in and the email belongs to an existing Person, show known name/email read-only and collect club name/note;
     - if signed in and no Person exists, collect name, club name, and note while using the signed-in email as read-only verified identity.
  6. Update request submission so it requires a signed-in identity email and never trusts a typed requester email for Staff-visible requests.
  7. Ensure email-only verification requests do not create onboarding request records or Staff notifications.
  8. Ensure verified request submission does not create Person, club, membership, or club access.
  9. Preserve Staff request inbox and notification behaviour for verified submitted requests.
  10. Preserve Staff conversion/rejection semantics for verified submitted requests, including creating/reusing the Person during conversion.
  11. Add or update controller/LiveView tests for signed-out email-only step, magic-link return-to, verified identity with no Person, verified identity with existing Person, and no Staff visibility before verification.
  12. Add or update domain/context tests proving request creation requires a verified identity email and does not create membership-domain records.
  13. Update Cucumber step definitions only as needed during delivery to exercise the `@iteration-030` scenarios.
  14. Remove or narrow `@todo-domain`/`@todo-ui` from the new/updated scenarios only when they pass in the relevant runner.
  15. Run `dev check`.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  - Exact function/module names for the email-only Get Started verification step.
  - Whether the existing auth sign-in UI/service can be reused directly with a `return_to`, or whether Get Started needs a thin wrapper around the token/email creation call.
  - Whether to persist any short-lived pre-verification UI state. The preferred slice avoids this by collecting name/club/note only after magic-link verification.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Memba Staff only triage onboarding requests from people who have proved control of the requester email address. Public visitors can create a verified identity/account session before requesting a club, without creating a Membership Person or gaining club access until Staff approve the request.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Review `acceptance-tests/features/request_account.feature` language for the new verified-request examples before delivery.
  - During implementation, add web tests for the signed-out email-only Get Started step, magic-link return-to, verified request form, and signed-in existing-person form.
  - Add tests proving Staff do not see or receive notification for an abandoned email-only verification.
  - Add tests proving verified request submission creates no Person, club, membership, or club access.
  - Run the updated Cucumber scenarios after implementation with appropriate todo tags removed or narrowed.
  - Run `dev check`.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - This iteration changes a currently working public request flow; preserve the low-friction feel by making the email-first step clear and the post-link form obvious.
  - Staff notifications will move later in the flow, so abandoned email-only attempts become invisible by design. If Matt later wants visibility into abandoned attempts, capture that as a separate operational analytics problem rather than making them Staff-actionable requests.
  - This does not add CAPTCHA/rate limiting. If abuse continues through verified emails, a future anti-abuse iteration may be needed.

You are independently reviewing the completed, plan-conforming implementation of the iteration plan at docs/iterations/030-verified-onboarding-requests/plan.md.

Use the prior context: the plan text, collected implementation evidence, current working tree state, commit range from `4bbaa97b6cdd8bd810bcf1ffefff58f6f42c4bc1..HEAD`, and the successful dev check output. Be strict, practical, and specific. Do not edit files.

This workflow reviews an already-committed implementation after the implementation workflow has proved plan conformance. The review job is code polish plus smell radar: refactoring, maintainability, project conventions, ADR conformance, and surfacing judgement-worthy non-blocking smells. Do not emit shell-command/tool-call JSON; return the Markdown review report only.

Automated tests are the behavioural feedback loop in this workflow. If you find a likely behavioural gap, missing acceptance criterion, or inadequate automated coverage despite green dev check, flag it as a blocking issue requiring a new implementation/test pass or human decision; do not disguise it as refactoring feedback. Do not ask for feature-file edits.

Review against these questions:

0. ADR conformance
   - Read every ADR cited by the plan and any nearby/current ADRs under `docs/adr/` that govern touched architecture.
   - Does the implementation obey accepted ADR decisions and consequences as binding constraints?
   - Does it avoid replacing ADR-mandated infrastructure or architecture with simpler local substitutes, unless the plan explicitly deferred that decision?
   - Do tests and implementation evidence prove the ADR-relevant behaviour, wiring, or structure?
   - Reject if the implementation conflicts with accepted ADRs or omits a cited ADR's central decision without an explicit plan deferral or human decision.

1. Light plan-fidelity sanity check
   - Does the implementation appear consistent with the stated goal and capability, given the plan-conformance gate has already passed?
   - Did it avoid obvious out-of-scope work?
   - If you find a substantial plan gap, classify it as blocking and requiring human input or a new implementation pass.

2. Behaviour and automated coverage
   - Did dev check pass before review?
   - Are important happy paths, edge cases, permissions, error states, and data/state changes covered by automated tests where appropriate?
   - Were acceptance feature files left unchanged as domain acceptance criteria?

3. Technical quality / refactoring
   - Are Phoenix, LiveView, HEEx, Ecto, Tailwind, and Elixir conventions followed where relevant?
   - Are migrations, schemas, contexts, tests, routes, UI, background jobs, and integrations coherent?
   - Is the implementation maintainable, minimal, and well factored?

4. Code-health classification
   - Blocking: ADR violations, behavioural gaps, missing or unsafe coverage, repeated blockers, or anything needing product/architecture judgement before merge.
   - Bounded-safe: concrete, low-risk refactoring, maintainability, convention, or test-quality fixes an agent can apply without changing product behaviour or feature files.
   - Judgement-worthy non-blocking: design smells, coupling, duplication, naming, dependency, or architecture drift that might merit human judgement later but should not block this merge.

- Confidence: High, Medium, or Low
- ADR conformance: PASS or FAIL

- Blocking issues: numbered list
- Bounded-safe fixes: numbered list
- Judgement-worthy non-blocking code-health findings: numbered list; for each include file(s), smell, and why it may need human judgement
