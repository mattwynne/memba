## Stage: read_plan
- Status: succeeded
- Handler: command
- Script: `PLAN_PATH='docs/iterations/010-shared-magic-link-auth/plan.md'
if [ ! -f "$PLAN_PATH" ]; then
  echo "Plan file not found: $PLAN_PATH" >&2

- Output:
  ```
  (139 lines omitted)
      - context/token tests,
      - auth email tests using Swoosh test facilities or an adapter stub,
      - controller/LiveView tests for `/auth`, callback, sign out, home page variants, admin access, and member authorization.
  11. Update operational documentation for auth Postmark environment variables and the required message stream.
  12. Run `bin/dev check` and fix regressions.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  - Exact module name: prefer `Memba.Accounts` if following Phoenix convention, or `Memba.Identity` if we want to avoid implying full account management.
  - Exact callback route under `/auth`: choose the clearest route during implementation, keeping the sign-in form at `/auth`.
  - Exact Swoosh/Postmark option for message streams. Confirm adapter support; if insufficient, use Req against Postmark directly for auth emails while still following the project rule to use Req for HTTP.
  - Whether to persist staff identities. Staff authorization can be derived from email alone, but an identity row may still be useful for token/session audit.
  - Whether unauthenticated access to protected routes redirects to `/auth` with a return path. Prefer preserving the originally requested path, including `club_id`, where safe.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  People can authenticate with Memba using only their email address. The app can distinguish staff access from club membership access after sign-in, support people with multiple clubs, and support people who are both staff and members.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `bin/dev check`.
  - Automated tests should prove:
    - token hashes are stored, not plaintext tokens,
    - tokens expire,
    - tokens are single-use,
    - valid token consumption creates a browser session,
    - `/auth` does not reveal whether an email is known,
    - auth emails are constructed with the configured sender/stream and correct callback URL,
    - signed-in home page lists all clubs for an active member email,
    - staff see an Admin link,
    - staff can access `/admin/*`,
    - non-staff cannot access `/admin/*`,
    - membership checks enforce `club_id` access,
    - the Postmark webhook route is unchanged.
  - Manual demo:
    1. Configure auth email Postmark settings in a controlled environment.
    2. Create a club and add a member with a real test email.
    3. Visit `/auth`, submit the email, receive the magic link, and follow it.
    4. Confirm `/` shows that member's club.
    5. Add the same email to a second club and confirm both clubs appear.
    6. Sign in with a `memba.io` address and confirm the Admin link appears and `/admin/*` is accessible.
    7. Confirm a non-staff member cannot access `/admin/*`.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Email-domain-only staff authorization is intentionally simple; later production hardening may require explicit staff records, MFA, or allow-lists.
  - Magic links sent through email inherit email account security risks; this is acceptable for the first product slice but should be revisited if admin capabilities become more sensitive.
  - Auth email deliverability may need a dedicated Postmark stream, template, and monitored sender reputation.
  - Club-domain sign-in and club-branded auth emails remain important follow-ups.
  - Query-string `club_id` is temporary and should be replaced by host/domain club resolution when custom domains are implemented.

You are independently reviewing an iteration plan before implementation.

Use the plan text from the preceding `Read Iteration Plan` stage. Do not assume any missing details. Be strict, practical, and specific.

Review the plan against these readiness questions:

1. Goal clarity
   - Is the goal clearly articulated?
   - Does it state the user/business outcome, not just tasks?
   - Is the intended beneficiary or actor clear?

2. Scope focus
   - Is the scope focused on one coherent outcome?
   - Could the iteration be any smaller while still useful?
   - Are non-goals and boundaries clear?

3. Acceptance criteria and business decisions
   - Are acceptance criteria concrete, clear, complete, and objectively testable?
   - Do they cover happy paths, important edge cases, permissions, error states, and data/state changes where relevant?
   - Are any business, product, policy, copy, workflow, or domain decisions still unresolved?

4. Implementation plan and technical decisions
   - Are implementation steps clear, ordered, and specific?
   - Are likely files, modules, migrations, tests, interfaces, and integration points named where useful?
   - Are data model, API, UI, workflow, integration, and background-job changes clear enough?
   - Are any technical decisions still unresolved?

5. Expected capability and validation
   - What should we be able to do after this iteration that we cannot do now?
   - How will we prove success?
   - Is there a clear stop condition?

Return a Markdown report with:

- Decision: READY or NOT READY
- Confidence: High, Medium, or Low
- Blocking gaps: numbered list
- Non-blocking improvements: numbered list
- Smallest viable iteration: your recommended smallest useful slice
- Required plan edits: concrete edits the author should make
- Validation plan: how to prove the iteration succeeded

At the end of your response, include one final JSON object for workflow routing. It must be the last thing in the response and must not be wrapped in a Markdown code fence.

Use these keys exactly so the synthesis stage can fail closed if reviewer findings are not visible in context:

- `gemini_review_decision`: `READY` or `NOT READY`
- `gemini_review_confidence`: `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`
- `gemini_review_blocking_gap_count`: integer count of blocking gaps
- `gemini_review_blocking_gaps`: concise semicolon-separated blocking gaps, or `None`
- `gemini_review_required_edits`: concise semicolon-separated required edits, or `None`

Examples:

{"context_updates":{"gemini_review_decision":"READY","gemini_review_confidence":"High","gemini_review_blocking_gap_count":0,"gemini_review_blocking_gaps":"None","gemini_review_required_edits":"None"}}

{"context_updates":{"gemini_review_decision":"NOT READY","gemini_review_confidence":"High","gemini_review_blocking_gap_count":2,"gemini_review_blocking_gaps":"Ordering is not decided; Acceptance criteria omit visible table columns","gemini_review_required_edits":"State ordering; Define table columns and row identity"}}
