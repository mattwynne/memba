  1. Inspect current authenticated club-site routes and the design references listed above.
  2. Add member acceptance support:
     - keep staff setup helpers for `Given` steps;
     - add `withMemberHarness(world, memberName, action)` that signs in by magic link using the member email;
     - add a guard/helper convention so member action/assertion helpers fail if they reach `/admin/*`.
  3. Update member step definitions so:
     - `When Alice sends...` uses Alice's member session and the club-home send flow;
     - `When Alice/Bob views...` uses that member's session and `GET /messages/:message_id?club_id=<club_id>`;
     - receipt assertions read member-facing recipient rows, labels, and icons.
  4. Build/refine member club home at `GET /?club_id=<club_id>`:
     - recent messages link to member message detail;
     - active members summary/list;
     - inline compose form/action based on the wireframe's compose design.
  5. Add member message detail at `GET /messages/:message_id?club_id=<club_id>`:
     - authorize active membership for the `club_id` query param;
     - ensure the message belongs to that club;
     - show subject, body, sender, and addressed members with grouped receipt statuses and stable recipient rows.
  6. Add a presentation mapping for member receipt labels and Heroicons without changing internal projection values.
  7. Keep staff/admin diagnostics unchanged on `/admin/messages/:message_id` and `/admin/deliveries`.
  8. Add focused tests for member route authorization, message-club ownership checks, status label/icon mapping, and no operator-only fields on member pages.
  9. Remove `@wip` from `member_message_deliverability.feature` when browser scenarios pass.
  10. Run `dev check`.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  None known. Route shape, compose placement, receipt display, and icon source are decided in Scope and Implementation Plan.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Memba can prove member-message behaviour through the actual member experience. Members can send a club message and inspect member-friendly receipts for everyone addressed, while detailed deliverability diagnostics remain staff/operator-only.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `dev check`.
  - Browser Cucumber passes with `member_message_deliverability.feature` untagged.
  - Targeted browser evidence proves:
    - setup may use staff/admin routes;
    - Alice sends from an authenticated member session;
    - Alice/Bob view receipt statuses from authenticated member sessions;
    - member assertions do not navigate to `/admin/*`.
  - Phoenix tests cover member route authorization, message-club ownership, status label/icon mapping, and member detail rendering without operator-only fields.
  - Manual demo script: `docs/iterations/011-member-facing-message-behaviour/manual-demo-script.md`.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Existing acceptance support is staff-harness-heavy; separating setup from member assertions may reveal coupling.
  - Query-string `club_id` remains temporary until custom domains exist.
  - The member-facing receipt policy may later need role controls if clubs consider receipts sensitive.
  - The sender-included rule is provisional.
  - The design reference is richer than this slice; avoid unrelated features.

You are independently reviewing an iteration plan before implementation.

Use the plan text from the preceding `Read Iteration Plan` stage. Do not assume any missing details. Be strict, practical, and specific.

Review the plan against these readiness questions:

1. Goal clarity
   - Is the goal clearly articulated?
   - Does it state the user/business outcome, not just tasks?
   - Is the intended beneficiary or actor clear?

2. Scope focus
   - Is the scope focused on one coherent outcome?
   - Could the iteration be any smaller while still useful?
   - Are non-goals and boundaries clear?

3. Acceptance criteria, BDD scenario decision, and business decisions
   - Are acceptance criteria concrete, clear, complete, and objectively testable?
   - Do they cover happy paths, important edge cases, permissions, error states, and data/state changes where relevant?
   - Does the plan classify the iteration as behaviour-facing or technical/engineering?
   - For behaviour-facing or domain-policy changes, does the plan include an `## Acceptance Scenarios / Feature Files` section naming the shared Cucumber feature file(s)/scenarios that will express the rules, or an explicit rationale for why Gherkin would not add useful stakeholder-readable examples?
   - Are any business, product, policy, copy, workflow, or domain decisions still unresolved?

4. Implementation plan and technical decisions
   - Are implementation steps clear, ordered, and specific?
   - Are likely files, modules, migrations, tests, interfaces, and integration points named where useful?
   - Are data model, API, UI, workflow, integration, and background-job changes clear enough?
   - Are any technical decisions still unresolved?

5. Expected capability and validation
   - What should we be able to do after this iteration that we cannot do now?
   - How will we prove success?
   - Is there a clear stop condition?

Return a Markdown report with:

- Decision: READY or NOT READY
- Confidence: High, Medium, or Low
- Blocking gaps: numbered list
- Non-blocking improvements: numbered list
- Smallest viable iteration: your recommended smallest useful slice
- Required plan edits: concrete edits the author should make
- Validation plan: how to prove the iteration succeeded

At the end of your response, include one final JSON object for workflow routing. It must be the last thing in the response and must not be wrapped in a Markdown code fence.

Use these keys exactly so the synthesis stage can fail closed if reviewer findings are not visible in context:

- `gemini_review_decision`: `READY` or `NOT READY`
- `gemini_review_confidence`: `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`
- `gemini_review_blocking_gap_count`: integer count of blocking gaps
- `gemini_review_blocking_gaps`: concise semicolon-separated blocking gaps, or `None`
- `gemini_review_required_edits`: concise semicolon-separated required edits, or `None`

Examples:

{"context_updates":{"gemini_review_decision":"READY","gemini_review_confidence":"High","gemini_review_blocking_gap_count":0,"gemini_review_blocking_gaps":"None","gemini_review_required_edits":"None"}}

{"context_updates":{"gemini_review_decision":"NOT READY","gemini_review_confidence":"High","gemini_review_blocking_gap_count":2,"gemini_review_blocking_gaps":"Ordering is not decided; Acceptance criteria omit visible table columns","gemini_review_required_edits":"State ordering; Define table columns and row identity"}}
