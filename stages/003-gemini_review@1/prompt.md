Run ID: 01KSYNDAN3BXGKDH496EJRBW0R
Pipeline progress: 1 of 13 stages completed

## Stage: read_plan
- Status: succeeded
- Handler: command
- Script: `PLAN_PATH='docs/iterations/009-routing-and-liveview-surface-split/plan.md'
if [ ! -f "$PLAN_PATH" ]; then
  echo "Plan file not found: $PLAN_PATH" >&2
  exit 1
fi
printf 'PLAN_PATH=%s\n\n' "$PLAN_PATH"
sed -n '1,260p' "$PLAN_PATH"`
- Output:
  ```
  (102 lines omitted)
     - `ClubsLive.Index` → `Admin.ClubsLive.Index`.
     - `ClubsLive.Show` → `Admin.ClubsLive.Show`.
     - `MessagesLive.Show` → `Admin.MessagesLive.Show`.
     - `DeliveriesLive.Index` → `Admin.DeliveriesLive.Index`.
  3. Update all internal verified routes and links:
     - Club list/detail links should use `/admin/clubs` and `/admin/clubs/:club_id`.
     - Message diagnostic links should use `/admin/messages/:message_id`.
     - Delivery overview links should use `/admin/deliveries`.
  4. Add or adjust layout functions in `MembaWeb.Layouts`:
     - Keep a Memba-branded public/app layout for marketing/legal pages.
     - Add an admin layout for staff pages, with utilitarian Memba chrome.
     - Add a club-site layout seam for future white-label pages using CSS custom properties with a neutral slate default, but do not wire fake club routing into production routes.
  5. Update the homepage links and labels so the primary operational link points to `/admin/clubs` if retained, or is presented as an internal/admin link rather than a public user journey.
  6. Update controller and LiveView tests to assert the new paths.
  7. Add route tests asserting old harness paths do not return the old pages.
  8. Run `bin/dev check` and fix any route/module/test failures.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  - Whether to physically move LiveView files into `web/lib/memba_web/live/admin/...` or leave files in place while renaming modules. Prefer moving files to match module names.
  - Whether to introduce a `:staff_browser` pipeline now for future staff auth, or keep `:browser` with a clearly named `/admin` scope. Prefer a `:staff_browser` pipeline that currently delegates to `:browser`-equivalent plugs, leaving an obvious auth insertion point.
  - Whether the club-site layout seam should be a real `Layouts.club_site` function now or a documented placeholder module/component. Prefer a real layout function with default theme assigns because it is small and guides future work.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  The application will have a clean routing and module structure that reflects the product's three surfaces. Staff tools will no longer masquerade as public pages, and future club-member work can start from a named white-label surface instead of extracting behaviour from the harness.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `bin/dev check`.
  - Automated route/controller/LiveView tests should cover:
    - public pages still work,
    - admin routes render the moved pages,
    - old harness routes no longer render the old pages,
    - Postmark webhook route remains available.
  - Manual smoke test:
    1. Open `/` and confirm public homepage renders.
    2. Open `/admin/clubs`, create a club, and open its detail page.
    3. Add or view members on `/admin/clubs/:club_id`.
    4. Send or inspect a message if test data is available.
    5. Open `/admin/messages/:message_id` and confirm diagnostics are staff-facing.
    6. Open `/admin/deliveries` and confirm the operator overview renders.
    7. Confirm `/clubs` does not render the club list.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - This does not provide real security for `/admin/*`; staff auth must be a later slice before real users or sensitive data are present.
  - The member-facing white-label routes are intentionally not exposed yet. The next member-facing slice should start with real club resolution and/or magic-link auth rather than temporary URL hacks.
  - Moving modules can break tests that refer to route paths, DOM IDs, or module names; keep DOM IDs stable where acceptance tests depend on them.
  - The existing `ClubsLive.Show` still mixes add-member, send-message, and message list responsibilities. Further extraction should happen when member-facing noticeboard/compose pages are implemented.

You are independently reviewing an iteration plan before implementation.

Use the plan text from the preceding `Read Iteration Plan` stage. Do not assume any missing details. Be strict, practical, and specific.

Review the plan against these readiness questions:

1. Goal clarity
   - Is the goal clearly articulated?
   - Does it state the user/business outcome, not just tasks?
   - Is the intended beneficiary or actor clear?

2. Scope focus
   - Is the scope focused on one coherent outcome?
   - Could the iteration be any smaller while still useful?
   - Are non-goals and boundaries clear?

3. Acceptance criteria and business decisions
   - Are acceptance criteria concrete, clear, complete, and objectively testable?
   - Do they cover happy paths, important edge cases, permissions, error states, and data/state changes where relevant?
   - Are any business, product, policy, copy, workflow, or domain decisions still unresolved?

4. Implementation plan and technical decisions
   - Are implementation steps clear, ordered, and specific?
   - Are likely files, modules, migrations, tests, interfaces, and integration points named where useful?
   - Are data model, API, UI, workflow, integration, and background-job changes clear enough?
   - Are any technical decisions still unresolved?

5. Expected capability and validation
   - What should we be able to do after this iteration that we cannot do now?
   - How will we prove success?
   - Is there a clear stop condition?

Return a Markdown report with:

- Decision: READY or NOT READY
- Confidence: High, Medium, or Low
- Blocking gaps: numbered list
- Non-blocking improvements: numbered list
- Smallest viable iteration: your recommended smallest useful slice
- Required plan edits: concrete edits the author should make
- Validation plan: how to prove the iteration succeeded

At the end of your response, include one final JSON object for workflow routing. It must be the last thing in the response and must not be wrapped in a Markdown code fence.

Use these keys exactly so the synthesis stage can fail closed if reviewer findings are not visible in context:

- `gemini_review_decision`: `READY` or `NOT READY`
- `gemini_review_confidence`: `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`
- `gemini_review_blocking_gap_count`: integer count of blocking gaps
- `gemini_review_blocking_gaps`: concise semicolon-separated blocking gaps, or `None`
- `gemini_review_required_edits`: concise semicolon-separated required edits, or `None`

Examples:

{"context_updates":{"gemini_review_decision":"READY","gemini_review_confidence":"High","gemini_review_blocking_gap_count":0,"gemini_review_blocking_gaps":"None","gemini_review_required_edits":"None"}}

{"context_updates":{"gemini_review_decision":"NOT READY","gemini_review_confidence":"High","gemini_review_blocking_gap_count":2,"gemini_review_blocking_gaps":"Ordering is not decided; Acceptance criteria omit visible table columns","gemini_review_required_edits":"State ordering; Define table columns and row identity"}}
