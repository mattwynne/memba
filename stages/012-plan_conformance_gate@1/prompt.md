  - `design-system/templates/club-group-members.html`: ordinary member rows, Add member action and picker.
  - `design-system/templates/club-group-non-member.html`: outside-admin Members view and Add yourself action.
  - `design-system/emails/group-welcome.html`: welcome email, with authenticated group link and no replay of old mail.
  - `design-system/explorations/custom-groups-prototype.html`: reviewed final interactions.
  
  Omit removal/leave controls until 064. Group Members shows Add member in the sole contextual tab action position. Outside admin sees no Conversations or New message until actually added; Add yourself is explained as opting into history and emails. Use normal member rows even for one member. No invented joined dates or group-admin badges. Keep club invitation flow separate; custom-group Add member does not create people. Local designs are sufficient; cloud sync remains pending.
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  
  - Every active group member can add another active member of that club, regardless of their club-admin role.
  - Any active club admin can manage additions in any custom group, including self-add, without reading conversations or joining as a side effect of adding someone else.
  - A regular club member outside the group cannot self-add, add another person or use a forged action to bypass the rule.
  - Pending invitees, former members and members of another club are not eligible. The action never creates or restores club membership.
  - New membership gives the whole history and write participation immediately; the welcome email links to the authenticated group page. Old conversation emails are not resent.
  - Repeating an already-applied addition does not create another membership transition or repeat its welcome. A genuine later re-add sends a new welcome but does not restore old follows cleared on departure.
  - Everyone and Admin retain automatic/role-based membership. The custom-group API cannot grant a club-admin role or bypass system-group rules.
  - Existing group recipients exclude nonmember admins; additions and permissions refresh in open views.
  
  ## Open Business Decisions
  
  None known. Deliver the welcome to the member's existing verified primary email; use the existing provider-neutral mailer/sender conventions and group-branded content. No new preferences or special delivery-status screen is introduced.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Add a public authenticated custom-group admission use case and actor-bearing command handled by `Membership.Club`. Evaluate actor active club membership, actor group membership or existing admin permission, target active membership and custom-group identity against current aggregate state. Preserve trusted system-group commands rather than exposing them directly to web callers.
  2. Reuse `GroupMemberAdded` and the existing projection. Make duplicate addition an idempotent no-op and carry sufficient actor/new-transition information for the welcome use case. Respect the departure/rejoin cleanup introduced in 062; no projection-only mutation or restoration shortcut.
  3. Extend `MemberDashboardPresentation`, shared member components and the group Members surface with the picker and admin self-add. Use explicit component attributes/slots, not a copied full-page template. Query candidates through Membership's public API, reauthorize on submit and render fresh membership after a successful transition.
  4. Add a small provider-neutral group-welcome composer using `Memba.EmailTemplates` and the existing `Memba.Mailer` handoff conventions. Send only after a confirmed new membership transition, not on projection replay, duplicate requests or ordinary group reads. Keep provider side effects out of aggregates/projectors; committed membership must not be represented as rolled back if delivery fails. Reuse default operational/error handling; do not build a notification framework, bespoke retry UI or delivery-status feature.
  5. Implement the tagged admission/history scenarios, including outside-admin self-add, duplicate additions, inactive/cross-club targets and system-group bypass attempts. Test replay does not resend welcomes, already-open views update, and existing invitation/role behaviour is unchanged. Run `dev check` on the exact delivery state.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  No new aggregate is needed. Use explicit per-use-case command results or new-event metadata to distinguish a new addition from an idempotent no-op; never infer that distinction by racing a projection preflight. Use the existing mailer abstraction and primary-email API instead of a new provider dependency. The welcome route is a normal group URL requiring sign-in, not a token granting membership.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  A group can grow through its own members without involving a club admin; an admin can join or populate it explicitly without gaining hidden access beforehand.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Planning parser and runner-debt checks; stakeholder review completed during discovery and prototype review.
  - Aggregate tests for actor/target/club identity, current permission, duplicates and concurrent changes.
  - Membership/Messaging integration for history and normal email eligibility with no replay of historic conversation emails.
  - Mailer tests for content, recipient, group link, a new transition versus duplicate/replay, using the test adapter rather than real email.
  - Browser demo: Bob adds Carol; Dan adds Eve without joining; Dan adds himself; ordinary outsider cannot add anyone; role/system regressions.
  - Both Cucumber runners and full `dev check` on the final delivery state.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  The raw group commands currently serve trusted policies/backfills and are not a safe web authorization API. Do not expose them unchanged. Welcome delivery cannot undo membership: avoid conflating domain success and provider outcome. Leave/removal and their controls are intentionally deferred to 064; club-departure safety already exists from 062.

You are the plan conformance gate for the iteration implementation at docs/iterations/063-add-custom-group-members/plan.md.

Use the prior context: the plan text, the implementation todo list, collected implementation evidence, current working tree state, commit range, and successful dev check output. Do not edit files.

Purpose:

- Decide whether the current implementation satisfies the explicit requirements in the plan.
- Treat passing dev check as necessary but not sufficient.
- Treat explicit plan requirements as binding deliverables, not optional implementation strategy.
- Use the implementation todo list as execution-state evidence, but do not let checked boxes override missing code, config, migration, or test evidence.

Process:

1. Read the plan's goal, scope, acceptance criteria, implementation plan, and validation plan sections.
2. Read the todo list generated and maintained by the implementation workflow.
3. Identify every explicit requirement using keywords like "Add", "Implement", "Configure", "Run", "Use", "Provide", and "Execute".
4. For each explicit requirement, inspect the collected evidence: changed files, code modules, configuration files, migrations, test files, and test output.
5. Compare test evidence with each explicit requirement.
6. Decide whether gaps are absent, safely repairable in a bounded pass, or require human input.

Acceptance rules:

- If the plan explicitly says "Implement X" and X is missing or incomplete, do not pass the gate.
- If the plan mandates a specific architecture, library, protocol, adapter, migration, test type, or external command, require concrete evidence for it.
- If the implementation uses a materially different architecture or behaviour from the approved plan, route to PLAN_REWORK when the repair is bounded by the plan, or HUMAN_INPUT when the difference needs a product or architecture decision.
- If the plan requires specific test types and those tests are missing, insufficient, or do not cover the requirements, route to PLAN_REWORK or HUMAN_INPUT.
- If tests pass but do not actually prove or cover the explicit plan requirements, route to PLAN_REWORK or HUMAN_INPUT.
- Never downgrade explicit plan requirements to optional implementation strategy unless routing to HUMAN_INPUT with a clear question about scope reduction.
- If the same plan gap appears to have recurred after plan rework, prefer HUMAN_INPUT over repeated repair loops.
- If a requirement is blocked, ambiguous, contradictory, or needs a product/architecture decision, route to HUMAN_INPUT.
- Treat acceptance feature files as locked unless the plan has a `## Allowed acceptance feature changes` section naming the exact file and allowed kind of change. Any implementation feature-file edit must stay within that explicit permission and preserve/validate the coverage promised by the plan; any other repair requiring feature-file changes needs HUMAN_INPUT.

Report format:

Return a concise Markdown report with:

- Decision: PLAN_CONFORMANT, PLAN_REWORK, or HUMAN_INPUT
- Requirements checked (list each explicit requirement from the plan)
- Missing or weak requirements, each with:
  - Requirement text from the plan
  - Expected evidence (code/config/tests/migrations/commands)
  - Observed evidence (what exists, what is missing)
  - Gap severity
- Exact repair brief if rework is safe and bounded
- Human question if human input is needed

End your response with exactly one JSON object that Fabro can use for routing:

If plan conformant:
{"context_updates":{"plan_conformant":true,"plan_rework_available":false}}

If bounded plan rework is appropriate:
{"context_updates":{"plan_conformant":false,"plan_rework_available":true}}

If human input is required:
{"context_updates":{"plan_conformant":false,"plan_rework_available":false}}
