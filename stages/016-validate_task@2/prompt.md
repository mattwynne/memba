  22. Update browser acceptance step support only as needed to express the new `@wip` scenarios after implementation begins.
  23. Keep all new acceptance scenarios tagged `@wip` until delivery implements the required step support and application behaviour.
  24. Run `dev check`.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  None expected to block implementation.
  
  Decisions made during planning:
  
  - Inbound email idempotency is event-sourced, not projection-invented. Use a deterministic inbound aggregate/process identity based on `{provider, provider_message_id}` and emit inbound accepted/rejected events before projecting support/audit state.
  - Add a defensive unique database constraint on `{provider, provider_message_id}` in the inbound source projection/read model, but keep the aggregate/event stream as the command-side source of truth.
  - Resend inbound webhooks use the existing Svix signature verification module, `MembaWeb.ResendWebhookSignature`. Production inbound webhook handling must be signed; development/test can be unsigned only when no signing secret is configured.
  - The Resend inbound parser contract for this iteration is an `email.received`-style payload with message fields under `data`: provider message id (`email_id` or `id`), `from`, `to`, optional `cc`/`bcc`, `subject`, `text`, optional `html`, optional `attachments`, and optional `headers`.
  - Rejection emails may be sent synchronously during webhook handling for this slice if that is the smallest safe implementation, but duplicate provider message ids must not send duplicate rejections.
  - Quote/signature stripping should be conservative and plain-text only.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  A member can see the club's inbound email address on the member dashboard and compose page, then post to the whole club by email using that address. Memba can receive provider inbound email payloads, route them to clubs, authorize senders, create normal club messages, reject unsupported inbound emails politely, and handle provider retries without duplicate messages.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `dev check`.
  - Run targeted messaging context tests for the provider-neutral inbound email command/API.
  - Run targeted Resend inbound webhook controller/parser tests.
  - Run targeted mailer tests for rejection emails.
  - Run Cucumber configuration tests to confirm `@wip` scenarios are excluded from the default acceptance run until implemented.
  - After implementation removes or narrows `@wip` tags, run the affected Cucumber feature file.
  - Manual demo:
    1. Start the app locally with the local/test mailer.
    2. Ensure Kootenay Mountaineering Club has slug `kmc` and Alice is an active member with primary and alternate email addresses.
    3. Submit a realistic Resend inbound webhook payload representing Alice emailing `kmc@clubs.memba.io` with subject `Trip planning night` and a plain-text body.
    4. Confirm the message appears in KMC member views as a normal club message from Alice.
    5. Confirm KMC active members receive outbound club-message email and Nelson Paddling Club members do not.
    6. Submit the same example from Alice's alternate email address and confirm it is posted as Alice.
    7. Submit examples from an unknown sender and from Pat, who is not a KMC member, and confirm no message appears and each sender receives a rejection email.
    8. Submit an example with an attachment and confirm it is rejected with an attachment-not-supported email.
    9. Submit an HTML-only example and confirm it is rejected with a plain-text-required email.
    10. Submit an example with quoted content/signature and confirm only the new message text appears in the posted club message.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Resend inbound webhook support may have payload details that differ from the planned `email.received` parser contract. Keep the Resend-specific parser isolated and covered by realistic payload tests.
  - Inbound webhook idempotency crosses aggregate, projection, database constraint, and outbound side effects. Tests must prove duplicate provider message ids do not create duplicate club messages or duplicate emails.
  - Quote/signature stripping can easily become too aggressive or too weak. Keep this conservative and covered by examples.
  - Rejection emails can create backscatter if sent to spoofed senders. This is acceptable for the first slice only if the implementation uses provider guidance and avoids replying to obviously invalid automated senders where practical.
  - Ignoring HTML is a deliberate short-term simplification. A later rich-content iteration should preserve, sanitise, render, and forward safe HTML rather than adding throwaway HTML-to-text conversion now.
  - Attachments are rejected for now. A later iteration should decide storage, scanning, visibility, and delivery semantics.
  - Future channel/sub-group addressing and custom club-owned inbound domains may change address generation and routing.

  # Implementation TODO
  
  - [x] 001 Inspect the existing messaging command flow, membership/person email-address lookup, club slug lookup, outbound email provider flow, Resend webhook controller/signature verifier, router webhook scope, current member dashboard/compose surfaces, and current acceptance support.
  - [x] 002 Add a small helper for deriving the club inbound address from the existing club slug and configured inbound domain, defaulting to `clubs.memba.io` for this slice.
  - [x] 003 Show the derived inbound address on the member dashboard and member compose page for the selected club.
  - [x] 004 Introduce an internal inbound email data structure and command/API in the messaging context that is independent of Resend. Include sender address, recipient addresses, subject, text body, HTML body if present, attachment metadata, provider message id, provider event id if present, and provider name.
  - [x] 005 Model inbound email as a small aggregate/process keyed by deterministic identity such as `inbound-email:<provider>:<provider_message_id>`. The aggregate handles exactly one provider inbound message id and makes duplicate handling explicit.
  - [x] 006 Add inbound email events such as:
  - [x] 007 Add a projection/read model such as `messaging_inbound_email_sources` driven only by inbound email events. It should expose provider, provider message id, status, message id for accepted emails, rejection reason for rejected emails, and timestamps for audit/support. Add a unique index on `{provider, provider_message_id}` as a defensive database constraint, but do not rely on projection-only state as the source of truth.
  - [x] 008 Add destination resolution for `<club-slug>@clubs.memba.io` that finds the club by slug and rejects unsupported recipient addresses or unknown slugs.
  - [x] 009 Add sender resolution that finds a person by any primary or alternate email address.
  - [x] 010 Add active-membership authorization for the resolved sender and destination club.
  - [x] 011 Reuse or wrap the existing web-composed club-message command so accepted inbound email creates the same message, recipients, delivery records, and outbound deliveries as a member-composed message.
  - [x] 012 Add idempotency behaviour: if the same provider/provider message id is received again, return an accepted webhook response and do not emit another `MessageSent`, create another club message, or send duplicate outbound/rejection emails.
  - [x] 013 Add plain-text body normalization:
  - [x] 014 Add attachment rejection before message creation when inbound payload includes any attachments.
  - [x] 015 Add rejection-email delivery for unsupported inbound emails. Use the configured application mailer/provider path where practical, and keep rejection copy concise: reason plus support/contact guidance.
  - [x] 016 Add a Resend inbound webhook route/controller/parser for `email.received`-style inbound payloads. Support message fields under `data`: provider message id (`email_id` or `id`), `from`, `to`, optional `cc`/`bcc`, `subject`, `text`, optional `html`, optional `attachments`, and optional `headers`. Treat missing required fields as malformed/unprocessable and cover this with parser tests.
  - [ ] 017 Require the existing Svix-based `MembaWeb.ResendWebhookSignature` verification when a Resend signing secret is configured. Production must configure the signing secret for inbound webhooks. Development/test may run unsigned only when no signing secret is configured.
  - [ ] 018 Translate the Resend payload into the provider-neutral inbound email command/API and return provider-appropriate HTTP statuses for accepted webhook receipt versus malformed/unprocessable payloads.
  - [ ] 019 Add tests for member-visible inbound address display on dashboard and compose.
  - [ ] 020 Add tests for provider-neutral inbound behaviour:
  - [ ] 021 Add Resend webhook parser/controller tests for realistic inbound payloads, malformed payloads, signature-required behaviour, duplicate provider message id behaviour, and rejection paths.
  - [ ] 022 Update browser acceptance step support only as needed to express the new `@wip` scenarios after implementation begins.
  - [ ] 023 Keep all new acceptance scenarios tagged `@wip` until delivery implements the required step support and application behaviour.
  - [ ] 024 Run `dev check`.

  > ### Decision
  > **VALID**
  > 
  > ### Evidence
  > - **Completed todo/check-off evidence found:** Recent checkpoint `9237004` changes exactly one ordinary todo line: task `016` from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`. Tasks `001`–`015` were already checked, making `016` the first unchecked task at implementation start. No todo split/reorder/deletion was found.
  > - **Implementation artifacts found:** Checkpoint `9237004` adds:
  >   - `web/lib/memba_web/resend_inbound_email_parser.ex`
  >   - `web/lib/memba_web/controllers/resend_inbound_webhook_controller.ex`
  >   - route `POST /webhooks/resend/inbound` in `web/lib/memba_web/router.ex`
  >   - parser/controller tests under `web/test/memba_web/...`
  > - **Scope evidence:** Parser supports `email.received`, fields under `data`, `email_id`/`id`, `from`, `to`, optional `cc`/`bcc`, `subject`, `text`, optional `html`, optional `attachments`, and optional `headers`. Missing required fields are covered by parser tests and controller returns `422` for malformed payloads.
  > - **Tests run/results found:** Implementation summary reports focused parser/controller tests passing, Resend webhook regression tests passing, and full `dev check` passing (`454 tests, 0 failures`; `31 scenarios passed`). Live validation also ran `PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH" dev check --quick`, which passed with `454 tests, 0 failures`.
  > - **ADR/plan conformance notes:** Uses Phoenix route/controller structure, keeps Resend-specific parsing isolated while producing provider-neutral attrs, and does not couple web parsing to Membership internals. Signature enforcement remains explicitly scoped to next todo `017`, so absence of that behaviour in this checkpoint is not a validation failure for task `016`.
  > - **Acceptance feature files:** No `*.feature` files were changed in the implementation checkpoint.

  # Implementation TODO
  
  - [x] 001 Inspect the existing messaging command flow, membership/person email-address lookup, club slug lookup, outbound email provider flow, Resend webhook controller/signature verifier, router webhook scope, current member dashboard/compose surfaces, and current acceptance support.
  - [x] 002 Add a small helper for deriving the club inbound address from the existing club slug and configured inbound domain, defaulting to `clubs.memba.io` for this slice.
  - [x] 003 Show the derived inbound address on the member dashboard and member compose page for the selected club.
  - [x] 004 Introduce an internal inbound email data structure and command/API in the messaging context that is independent of Resend. Include sender address, recipient addresses, subject, text body, HTML body if present, attachment metadata, provider message id, provider event id if present, and provider name.
  - [x] 005 Model inbound email as a small aggregate/process keyed by deterministic identity such as `inbound-email:<provider>:<provider_message_id>`. The aggregate handles exactly one provider inbound message id and makes duplicate handling explicit.
  - [x] 006 Add inbound email events such as:
  - [x] 007 Add a projection/read model such as `messaging_inbound_email_sources` driven only by inbound email events. It should expose provider, provider message id, status, message id for accepted emails, rejection reason for rejected emails, and timestamps for audit/support. Add a unique index on `{provider, provider_message_id}` as a defensive database constraint, but do not rely on projection-only state as the source of truth.
  - [x] 008 Add destination resolution for `<club-slug>@clubs.memba.io` that finds the club by slug and rejects unsupported recipient addresses or unknown slugs.
  - [x] 009 Add sender resolution that finds a person by any primary or alternate email address.
  - [x] 010 Add active-membership authorization for the resolved sender and destination club.
  - [x] 011 Reuse or wrap the existing web-composed club-message command so accepted inbound email creates the same message, recipients, delivery records, and outbound deliveries as a member-composed message.
  - [x] 012 Add idempotency behaviour: if the same provider/provider message id is received again, return an accepted webhook response and do not emit another `MessageSent`, create another club message, or send duplicate outbound/rejection emails.
  - [x] 013 Add plain-text body normalization:
  - [x] 014 Add attachment rejection before message creation when inbound payload includes any attachments.
  - [x] 015 Add rejection-email delivery for unsupported inbound emails. Use the configured application mailer/provider path where practical, and keep rejection copy concise: reason plus support/contact guidance.
  - [x] 016 Add a Resend inbound webhook route/controller/parser for `email.received`-style inbound payloads. Support message fields under `data`: provider message id (`email_id` or `id`), `from`, `to`, optional `cc`/`bcc`, `subject`, `text`, optional `html`, optional `attachments`, and optional `headers`. Treat missing required fields as malformed/unprocessable and cover this with parser tests.
  - [ ] 017 Require the existing Svix-based `MembaWeb.ResendWebhookSignature` verification when a Resend signing secret is configured. Production must configure the signing secret for inbound webhooks. Development/test may run unsigned only when no signing secret is configured.
  - [ ] 018 Translate the Resend payload into the provider-neutral inbound email command/API and return provider-appropriate HTTP statuses for accepted webhook receipt versus malformed/unprocessable payloads.
  - [ ] 019 Add tests for member-visible inbound address display on dashboard and compose.
  - [ ] 020 Add tests for provider-neutral inbound behaviour:
  - [ ] 021 Add Resend webhook parser/controller tests for realistic inbound payloads, malformed payloads, signature-required behaviour, duplicate provider message id behaviour, and rejection paths.
  - [ ] 022 Update browser acceptance step support only as needed to express the new `@wip` scenarios after implementation begins.
  - [ ] 023 Keep all new acceptance scenarios tagged `@wip` until delivery implements the required step support and application behaviour.
  - [ ] 024 Run `dev check`.

  > 
  > 2. **Changes made**
  >    - Updated `MembaWeb.ResendInboundWebhookController` to:
  >      - Verify inbound Resend webhook signatures using existing `MembaWeb.ResendWebhookSignature` when a signing secret is configured.
  >      - Allow unsigned inbound webhooks only when no signing secret is configured.
  >      - Return `401` for signature/authentication failures and keep parser failures as `422`.
  >    - Updated `MembaWeb.ResendWebhookSignature` with `signing_secret_from_env!/2`:
  >      - Reads/trims `MEMBA_RESEND_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`.
  >      - Allows missing/blank secret outside production.
  >      - Raises in production when missing/blank, with an operator-facing error.
  >    - Updated `web/config/runtime.exs` to use the new production-enforcing config helper.
  >    - Added/updated tests:
  >      - Inbound controller tests for unsigned-allowed, signed-accepted, unsigned-rejected, and invalid-signature-rejected behaviour.
  >      - Signature config tests for env parsing and production-required behaviour.
  > 
  > 3. **Validation commands/results**
  >    - `cd web && mix format --check-formatted ...`
  >      - Passed.
  >    - `PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH" dev check --quick`
  >      - Passed: `460 tests, 0 failures`.
  >    - `PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH" dev check`
  >      - Passed: `460 tests, 0 failures`; `31 scenarios (31 passed)`.
  >    - Note: a direct focused `bin/mix test ...` attempt hit a sandbox/devenv duplicate Postgres startup lock, not a test failure. The full `dev check` successfully ran the new ExUnit tests.
  > 
  > 4. **Todo check-off made**
  >    - Changed exactly:
  >      - `- [ ] 017 Require the existing Svix-based ...`
  >      - to:
  >      - `- [x] 017 Require the existing Svix-based ...`
  > 
  > 5. **Todo splits/additions/reordering**
  >    - None.
  > 
  > 6. **ADR conformance**
  >    - ADR 0001: Kept the implementation in Phoenix controller/runtime config structure.
  >    - ADR 0016: Preserved Resend as a provider-specific webhook integration while using the existing shared signature verifier and runtime configuration boundary.
  >    - ADR 0014/0017: Production now fails early when the required webhook signing secret is absent, aligning with production secrets/release-state expectations.

Validate the just-completed iteration task for `docs/iterations/019-inbound-club-messages-by-email/plan.md`.

You have tool access. Use it. Decide from live repository state, not from summarized context alone. Read `/tmp/fabro-pre-validate-snapshot.md`, run `git status --short`, inspect `git diff`, inspect recent commits with `git log --oneline -5`, and read changed files as needed.

Important workflow contract: Fabro checkpoints after every node. Therefore, at validation time the just-completed task may appear either as uncommitted working-tree changes or as the latest/recent Fabro checkpoint commit on HEAD. A clean working tree is not, by itself, a failure.

Validate the task evidence, not a single storage mechanism. Prefer live working-tree diff/status when present; when the working tree is clean, corroborate the task using recent checkpoint commits and their diffs. Do not infer infrastructure faults unless live repository evidence proves the expected files or diffs are genuinely absent.

Do not rely on a selected-task temp file. Instead inspect the plan, `todo.md`, relevant ADRs, current repository diff/status, recent checkpoint diffs, test evidence, and the preceding implementation summary. Identify the completed task by the `todo.md` diff from the working tree or latest/recent checkpoint: exactly one ordinary task line should have changed from unchecked (`- [ ]`) to checked (`- [x]`) unless there is a clear plan-preserving split/reorder rationale.

## Validate

Accept the task only if all are true:

- The checked-off task is the first unchecked task that existed when the implementor started, or a clearly justified first slice after a plan-preserving split.
- The same task that was implemented has been checked off in `todo.md`.
- The task has concrete code/config/test/documentation evidence as appropriate; a todo-only change is invalid.
- The work stays within the approved plan and preserves plan-required scope.
- Any todo changes split/add/reorder only to satisfy the plan; no plan-required work was deleted, weakened, or silently deferred.
- Relevant automated tests were added/updated and focused tests were run, or a justified blocker was reported.
- Accepted ADR constraints relevant to this task are respected.
- Acceptance feature files (`*.feature`, including under `acceptance-tests/`) were not edited unless the plan has a `## Allowed acceptance feature changes` section naming the exact file and allowed kind of change; any permitted edit stays within that explicit permission and preserves/validates the coverage promised by the plan.
- The task is small enough to stand independently with a useful Fabro checkpoint evidence trail.

If validation fails but the task is still clear and safe to attempt again, request a clean retry from the last successful checkpoint. Do not ask for in-place repair. Only request human input when the task, plan, or repository state is ambiguous, unsafe, repeatedly failing for the same non-transient reason, or blocked by a decision/tooling issue that another clean attempt is unlikely to solve.

## Output format

Return concise Markdown with:

### Decision
One of: **VALID**, **RETRY**, or **HUMAN_INPUT**

### Evidence
- Completed todo/check-off evidence found.
- Implementation artifacts found.
- Tests run/results found.
- ADR/plan conformance notes.

### Retry brief
Only if RETRY: exact reason the attempt was rejected from live repository evidence, plus concise guidance for the next clean attempt. The workflow will snapshot the failed working tree before resetting and trying again.

### Human input
Only if HUMAN_INPUT: exact blocker/question.

End your response with exactly one JSON object for Fabro routing, not in a code fence:
