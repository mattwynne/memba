  - Provider open webhook events should be rejected as unsupported, not silently accepted.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Inspect current opened references in `web/lib`, `web/test`, `acceptance-tests/features`, active docs, and Postmark delivery code. Exclude old `docs/iterations/**` design/prototype artifacts from cleanup unless they are active validation inputs.
  2. Update shared acceptance feature expectations to remove opened receipts.
  3. Remove or deprecate the Messaging opened-report command/API/event path from current behaviour:
     - delete or stop routing `ReportEmailDeliveryOpened` command handling;
     - delete or stop emitting `EmailDeliveryOpened` for current command execution;
     - remove the delivered-to-opened transition from the aggregate;
     - ensure current public APIs and tests use delivered/problem statuses only.
  4. Update projections/read models and loaders so current status lists, summaries, and grouping functions do not include opened.
  5. Update Postmark outbound delivery so it does not set `track_opens: true` or any equivalent open-tracking option.
  6. Update Postmark webhook handling so open events are treated as unsupported and do not mutate delivery status.
  7. Update member LiveViews/presentation modules/tests to remove opened receipt segments, groups, toggles, counts, data attributes, and copy.
  8. Update Memba staff delivery views/tests to remove opened status expectations while preserving delivered/problem visibility.
  9. Update active operational/current-app documentation, especially Postmark email docs, to remove open-tracking instructions or claims.
  10. Run targeted tests while changing each layer, then run `dev check` and fix regressions.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  None known.
  
  Implementation notes:
  
  - If deleting old opened event modules would break event deserialization for local historic data, prefer keeping a compatibility shim that is not emitted by current code and is not exposed as current model behaviour. Do not add a data migration/backfill unless implementation discovers the app cannot boot or replay without one.
  - Keep webhook rejection consistent with the existing unsupported-event response style.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Memba can send and monitor member email delivery without pixel-based open tracking. The product vocabulary is simpler and avoids implying that Memba observes whether a recipient read a message.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run or update the shared acceptance harness so:
    - member deliverability scenarios pass with Sending, Delivered, and Delivery problem only;
    - staff deliverability scenarios pass without any opened scenario.
  - Run Messaging domain tests covering delivered, delayed, bounced, and spam complaint reports.
  - Run Postmark provider tests proving open tracking is not enabled.
  - Run Postmark webhook/controller tests proving open events are unsupported and do not alter delivery status.
  - Run member dashboard and member message LiveView tests proving opened groups/counts/copy are absent.
  - Run Memba staff delivery LiveView/tests proving opened status is absent while other statuses remain visible.
  - Run documentation/search checks such as `rg "opened|track_opens|open tracking" web/lib web/test acceptance-tests/features docs/email-delivery.md` and confirm remaining matches are either removed or explicitly historical/irrelevant.
  - Run `dev check`.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Removing old event modules entirely may be awkward if local event stores contain historic opened events. Keep compatibility internal if needed, but do not expose opened as current behaviour.
  - Third-party provider dashboards may still report opens independently if a stream was configured outside Memba. Document that Memba does not request or consume those signals.
  - Future engagement metrics, if ever wanted, should be planned as a separate product/privacy decision rather than reusing tracking pixels by accident.

  > 1. **Selected todo line**

  > 
  > 2. **Changes made**
  >    - Added a Cucumber configuration test in `web/test/features/cucumber_configuration_test.exs` asserting the two shared deliverability feature files do not describe opened/open receipt behaviour:
  >      - `acceptance-tests/features/member_message_deliverability.feature`
  >      - `acceptance-tests/features/memba_staff_email_deliverability.feature`
  >    - Did not edit the `.feature` files because they already contained the revised expectations: Sending, Delivered, and Delivery problem only; no staff opened scenario.
  >    - Did not change step definitions, matching the plan’s instruction to update expectations without changing Cucumber step definitions.
  > 
  > 3. **Focused validation**
  >    - `cd web && mix test test/features/cucumber_configuration_test.exs`
  >      - Failed in the bare shell because PostgreSQL was not available at the inherited `PGHOST=/tmp/devenv/postgres`.
  >    - `PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH" dev check`
  >      - Passed: `354 tests, 0 failures`.
  >    - Searched shared feature files for opened/open receipt wording:
  >      - `acceptance-tests/features/*.feature`: no `opened`, `open`, or `opens` matches in the deliverability features.

  >    - This task only updates living-documentation/test expectations and does not alter the aggregate, projections, provider handling, or app behaviour.
  >    - The added expectation aligns with the current iteration plan’s policy that opened receipts are no longer current behaviour, while leaving the broader ADR reconciliation for the later documentation task.

  >      - `acceptance-tests/features/memba_staff_email_deliverability.feature`
  >    - Did not edit the `.feature` files because they already contained the revised expectations: Sending, Delivered, and Delivery problem only; no staff opened scenario.
  >    - Did not change step definitions, matching the plan’s instruction to update expectations without changing Cucumber step definitions.
  > 
  > 3. **Focused validation**
  >    - `cd web && mix test test/features/cucumber_configuration_test.exs`
  >      - Failed in the bare shell because PostgreSQL was not available at the inherited `PGHOST=/tmp/devenv/postgres`.
  >    - `PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH" dev check`
  >      - Passed: `354 tests, 0 failures`.
  >    - Searched shared feature files for opened/open receipt wording:
  >      - `acceptance-tests/features/*.feature`: no `opened`, `open`, or `opens` matches in the deliverability features.
  > 
  > 4. **Todo check-off**
  >    - Changed:
  >      - `- [ ] 002 Update shared acceptance feature expectations to remove opened receipts.`
  >    - To:
  >      - `- [x] 002 Update shared acceptance feature expectations to remove opened receipts.`
  > 
  > 5. **Todo splits/additions/reordering**
  >    - None.
  > 
  > 6. **ADR conformance**
  >    - Read relevant ADRs `0004`, `0006`, `0012`, and `0016`.
  >    - This task only updates living-documentation/test expectations and does not alter the aggregate, projections, provider handling, or app behaviour.
  >    - The added expectation aligns with the current iteration plan’s policy that opened receipts are no longer current behaviour, while leaving the broader ADR reconciliation for the later documentation task.

Validate the just-completed iteration task for `docs/iterations/017-remove-open-tracking/plan.md`.

You have tool access. Use it. Decide from live repository state, not from summarized context alone. Read `/tmp/fabro-pre-validate-snapshot.md`, run `git status --short`, inspect `git diff`, inspect recent commits with `git log --oneline -5`, and read changed files as needed.

Important workflow contract: Fabro checkpoints after every node. Therefore, at validation time the just-completed task may appear either as uncommitted working-tree changes or as the latest/recent Fabro checkpoint commit on HEAD. A clean working tree is not, by itself, a failure.

Validate the task evidence, not a single storage mechanism. Prefer live working-tree diff/status when present; when the working tree is clean, corroborate the task using recent checkpoint commits and their diffs. Do not infer infrastructure faults unless live repository evidence proves the expected files or diffs are genuinely absent.

Do not rely on a selected-task temp file. Instead inspect the plan, `todo.md`, relevant ADRs, current repository diff/status, recent checkpoint diffs, test evidence, and the preceding implementation summary. Identify the completed task by the `todo.md` diff from the working tree or latest/recent checkpoint: exactly one ordinary task line should have changed from unchecked (`- [ ]`) to checked (`- [x]`) unless there is a clear plan-preserving split/reorder rationale.

## Validate

Accept the task only if all are true:

- The checked-off task is the first unchecked task that existed when the implementor started, or a clearly justified first slice after a plan-preserving split.
- The same task that was implemented has been checked off in `todo.md`.
- The task has concrete code/config/test/documentation evidence as appropriate; a todo-only change is invalid.
- The work stays within the approved plan and preserves plan-required scope.
- Any todo changes split/add/reorder only to satisfy the plan; no plan-required work was deleted, weakened, or silently deferred.
- Relevant automated tests were added/updated and focused tests were run, or a justified blocker was reported.
- Accepted ADR constraints relevant to this task are respected.
- Acceptance feature files (`*.feature`, including under `acceptance-tests/`) were not edited unless the plan has a `## Allowed acceptance feature changes` section naming the exact file and allowed kind of change; any permitted edit stays within that explicit permission and preserves/validates the coverage promised by the plan.
- The task is small enough to stand independently with a useful Fabro checkpoint evidence trail.

If validation fails but the task is still clear and safe to attempt again, request a clean retry from the last successful checkpoint. Do not ask for in-place repair. Only request human input when the task, plan, or repository state is ambiguous, unsafe, repeatedly failing for the same non-transient reason, or blocked by a decision/tooling issue that another clean attempt is unlikely to solve.

## Output format

Return concise Markdown with:

### Decision
One of: **VALID**, **RETRY**, or **HUMAN_INPUT**

### Evidence
- Completed todo/check-off evidence found.
- Implementation artifacts found.
- Tests run/results found.
- ADR/plan conformance notes.

### Retry brief
Only if RETRY: exact reason the attempt was rejected from live repository evidence, plus concise guidance for the next clean attempt. The workflow will snapshot the failed working tree before resetting and trying again.

### Human input
Only if HUMAN_INPUT: exact blocker/question.
