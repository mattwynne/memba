  ### Out of scope
  
  - Real Postmark integration, webhooks, tracking pixel HTTP endpoint.
  - Phoenix UI.
  - Read receipts beyond the boolean opened state.
  - Repeated-open analytics or device/client breakdowns.
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  
  - All scenarios in `member_message_deliverability.feature` pass under
    Elixir Cucumber.
  - All scenarios in `operator_email_deliverability.feature` pass under
    Elixir Cucumber, with reason text preserved for delayed, bounced, and
    spam complaint statuses.
  - Invalid status transitions are rejected by the Message aggregate.
  - Repeated equivalent status reports (including repeated opens) are
    idempotent.
  - The CRUD spike is fully removed where any remnants conflict with the
    event-sourced model.
  - `devenv shell mix precommit` passes.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Extend the Message aggregate with commands and events for delivered,
     delayed, bounced, spam complaint, and opened reports, plus the
     transition rules and idempotency checks.
  2. Add the member-facing receipt projection and query applying the ADR 0006
     mapping.
  3. Add the operator deliverability projection and query, preserving reason
     text on delayed, bounced, and spam complaint events.
  4. Add Cucumber step definitions for the remaining member receipt scenarios
     and all operator scenarios.
  5. Sweep the codebase for any remaining CRUD spike artefacts and remove
     them where they conflict with the event-sourced design.
  6. Run `devenv shell mix precommit` and fix any issues.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Both shared feature files pass end to end under Elixir Cucumber.
  - ExUnit covers status state machine rules, idempotency, and projector
    behaviour for both member receipts and operator views.
  - `devenv shell mix precommit` passes.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Live provider integration (likely Postmark) is the next iteration: real
    sending, webhook ingestion, tracking pixel endpoint, and a manual
    cross-inbox demo.
  - The operator view will evolve as we learn what operators actually need;
    the projection shape here is intentionally minimal.

  >      - `delayed` / `bounced` / `spam_complaint` → `"delivery problem"`

  > 6. **ADR conformance evidence**
  >    - ADR 0004: receipt projection is driven by delivery events from the single Message aggregate stream.
  >    - ADR 0006: member-facing query exposes only the simplified receipt vocabulary and maps delivery problems appropriately.
  >    - ADR 0009: implemented as a Commanded Ecto projection, not hand-rolled event handler plumbing.
  >    - ADR 0012: opened remains boolean-like; no open counts, timestamps, devices, or analytics were added.

Validate the just-completed iteration task for `docs/iterations/004-delivery-status-and-views/plan.md`.

You have tool access. Use it. Decide from live repository state, not from summarized context alone. Read `/tmp/fabro-pre-validate-snapshot.md`, run `git status --short`, inspect `git diff`, inspect recent commits with `git log --oneline -5`, and read changed files as needed.

Important workflow contract: Fabro checkpoints after every node. Therefore, at validation time the just-completed task may appear either as uncommitted working-tree changes or as the latest/recent Fabro checkpoint commit on HEAD. A clean working tree is not, by itself, a failure.

Validate the task evidence, not a single storage mechanism. Prefer live working-tree diff/status when present; when the working tree is clean, corroborate the task using recent checkpoint commits and their diffs. Do not infer infrastructure faults unless live repository evidence proves the expected files or diffs are genuinely absent.

Do not rely on a selected-task temp file. Instead inspect the plan, `todo.md`, relevant ADRs, current repository diff/status, recent checkpoint diffs, test evidence, and the preceding implementation summary. Identify the completed task by the `todo.md` diff from the working tree or latest/recent checkpoint: exactly one ordinary task line should have changed from unchecked (`- [ ]`) to checked (`- [x]`) unless there is a clear plan-preserving split/reorder rationale.

## Validate

Accept the task only if all are true:

- The checked-off task is the first unchecked task that existed when the implementor started, or a clearly justified first slice after a plan-preserving split.
- The same task that was implemented has been checked off in `todo.md`.
- The task has concrete code/config/test/documentation evidence as appropriate; a todo-only change is invalid.
- The work stays within the approved plan and preserves plan-required scope.
- Any todo changes split/add/reorder only to satisfy the plan; no plan-required work was deleted, weakened, or silently deferred.
- Relevant automated tests were added/updated and focused tests were run, or a justified blocker was reported.
- Accepted ADR constraints relevant to this task are respected.
- No acceptance feature files (`*.feature`, including under `acceptance-tests/`) were edited.
- The task is small enough to stand independently with a useful Fabro checkpoint evidence trail.

If validation fails but the task is still clear and safe to attempt again, request a clean retry from the last successful checkpoint. Do not ask for in-place repair. Only request human input when the task, plan, or repository state is ambiguous, unsafe, repeatedly failing for the same non-transient reason, or blocked by a decision/tooling issue that another clean attempt is unlikely to solve.

## Output format

Return concise Markdown with:

### Decision
One of: **VALID**, **RETRY**, or **HUMAN_INPUT**

### Evidence
- Completed todo/check-off evidence found.
- Implementation artifacts found.
- Tests run/results found.
- ADR/plan conformance notes.

### Retry brief
Only if RETRY: exact reason the attempt was rejected from live repository evidence, plus concise guidance for the next clean attempt. The workflow will snapshot the failed working tree before resetting and trying again.

### Human input
Only if HUMAN_INPUT: exact blocker/question.
