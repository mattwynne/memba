Goal: Review a completed plan-conforming iteration implementation for code polish, ADR conformance, and code-health signals

     - subject/body inputs using Phoenix form components;
     - “Send to all members” primary action and cancel/back action.
  7. Render success state based on `ComposeSuccess`, adding the required “Send another message” action.
  8. Render failure state based on `ComposeError`, adjusted to say nothing was sent and contact support; include Try again and Back to club home actions.
  9. Add or update LiveView/Phoenix tests for:
     - auth and selected-club requirements;
     - no sender dropdown;
     - sender derived from current member;
     - successful submit and success action links;
     - send failure state and support copy;
     - club home CTA replacing inline compose.
  10. Update acceptance step support only as needed for the new send-failure scenario and for existing normal-send steps to use the new compose flow without changing scenario wording.
      - Simulate send unavailability through test support rather than Gherkin wording. Prefer a test-only configuration seam around the existing message sending/delivery boundary (for example an application-env flag or fake-provider failure mode set by step support) so the feature can say only that sending is unavailable.
  11. Remove `@wip` from the new failure scenario once implemented and passing.
  12. Remove the legacy `POST /?club_id=<club_id>` send route and controller action in this slice once the LiveView submit path is covered. Do not keep a parallel member send endpoint unless a test reveals an existing non-UI caller that must be preserved.
  13. Run the targeted browser Cucumber feature and `dev check`.
  
  ## Technical Decisions
  
  - LiveView module: `MembaWeb.MemberMessageLive.New`.
  - Compose path: `GET /messages/new?club_id=<club_id>`; use Phoenix verified routes (`~p`) in implementation/tests.
  - Send-unavailability simulation: add/use a test-support seam around the sending boundary or fake provider configuration, configured by step support, without exposing infrastructure details in Gherkin.
  - Legacy inline send endpoint: remove the old `POST /?club_id=<club_id>` route/controller action once the LiveView submit path replaces it.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Members have a focused, calmer compose experience with clear post-send choices. Messages are sent as the logged-in member, and failure is treated as an incident with support guidance rather than a confusing form validation problem.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `dev check`.
  - Run targeted LiveView/Phoenix tests for the compose LiveView and club-home CTA.
  - Run `acceptance-tests/features/member_message_deliverability.feature` through the browser runner.
  - Manual demo:
    - sign in as Alice;
    - open Kootenay Mountaineering Club;
    - click “Send club message”;
    - confirm compose screen has no sender dropdown and shows Alice as sender;
    - send “Trip planning night”;
    - confirm success state shows “See who got it”, “Send another message”, and “Back to home”;
    - follow “See who got it” to the message detail page;
    - return and use “Send another message” to start a fresh compose;
    - simulate send failure and confirm the message was not sent, support guidance appears, and Try again/Home actions are available.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Existing browser helpers may assume the inline form exists; update helpers while keeping feature language business-focused.
  - Error simulation needs a clean test seam so the new Gherkin does not become infrastructure-specific.
  - Removing the sender dropdown changes a product affordance that existed accidentally; tests should make the new rule explicit.
  - Dashboard polish remains a future iteration.

Record judgement-worthy review findings for docs/iterations/013-member-compose-liveview-flow/plan.md.

Review runs after implementation has already merged to main. It must not block delivery. Use the review synthesis and reviewer reports to decide whether any finding needs human judgement rather than bounded automatic polish.

Rules:

- If there are no judgement-worthy findings, do not edit files. Say that no code-health entry is needed.
- If there are judgement-worthy findings, append them to `docs/code-health.md` under a dated section for this iteration.
- Do not log issues that were already fixed during this review run.
- Keep entries factual and actionable. Include the plan path, the finding, evidence, risk, and a suggested next action.
- Do not edit acceptance feature files.
- Do not change product behaviour in this step.

Return a concise summary of whether `docs/code-health.md` was updated and why.
