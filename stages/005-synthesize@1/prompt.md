  5. Implement caller-generated UUID aggregate identities per ADR 0011.
  6. Implement minimal Membership aggregates, commands, and events:
     - Club: create a club.
     - Person: create a person with name and email; person identity is club-independent.
     - Membership: add a person as an active member of a club. For this iteration, memberships are active from creation and cannot lapse, expire, or be revoked.
  7. Implement Membership projections/read models and a public Membership query API. Messaging must call this query API to resolve active club members; it must not depend directly on Membership Ecto schemas or projection tables.
  8. Implement the Messaging aggregate as one aggregate per message per ADR 0004.
  9. Implement `SendMessage` so the application service resolves recipients via Membership's query API and includes those resolved recipients in the command, per ADR 0005.
  10. Have the Message aggregate emit `MessageSent` plus one recipient delivery event per resolved recipient in the message stream.
  11. Implement the delivery status state machine inside the Message aggregate:
      - statuses: sent, delivered, delayed, bounced, spam complaint, opened;
      - member-facing mapping from ADR 0006;
      - opened semantics from ADR 0012;
      - invalid transitions rejected;
      - duplicate equivalent status reports idempotent.
  12. Define a fake/stub delivery provider port used by the message-sending service/tests. For this iteration, fake provider success means Memba has handed the delivery to the provider.
  13. Implement Messaging projections/read queries for messages, recipient deliveries, member-facing receipts, and operator deliverability details using `commanded_ecto_projections`.
  14. Configure Elixir Cucumber to read shared feature files from `acceptance-tests/features/**/*.feature` and execute domain step definitions from the Phoenix app test suite, per ADR 0010.
  15. Add domain-level Cucumber step definitions for the shared member-message and operator-deliverability scenarios using fake/stub ports.
  16. Keep the existing cucumber-js/Playwright setup available for future whole-app execution of the same scenarios, but do not implement the Phoenix UI layer in this iteration.
  17. Add lower-level ExUnit tests where useful for EventStore setup, aggregate rules, projector behaviour, status-transition idempotency, and fake provider interactions.
  18. Run `devenv shell mix precommit` and fix any issues.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  - Exact compatible package versions should be chosen during implementation for `commanded_eventstore_adapter`, `eventstore`, `commanded_ecto_projections`, and the GitHub Cucumber dependency.
  - Exact folder structure for Elixir Cucumber support code should be chosen during implementation, while preserving ADR 0010's shared feature-file paths.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  After this iteration, Memba will have event-sourced Membership and Messaging domain skeletons. It will be able to model a member sending a message to all active members of their club, create per-recipient delivery state, and project both simple member-facing receipt statuses and detailed operator deliverability information using a fake provider.
  
  This creates the product-shaped foundation for the next iteration: live Postmark sending, provider webhooks, tracking pixels, and a real deliverability demo with test inboxes.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Use the shared Cucumber feature files as the domain model specification for this iteration.
  - Run the shared scenarios against the Elixir domain model with `huddlz-hq/cucumber` and fake/stub ports.
  - Keep scenarios abstract from infrastructure so they can later run through cucumber-js/Playwright against the whole Phoenix app.
  - Add ExUnit tests for lower-level technical details that are not appropriate in Gherkin.
  - Run `devenv shell mix precommit` before considering implementation complete.
  - No live provider/manual inbox demo is required in this iteration; that belongs to the follow-up Postmark deliverability iteration.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - EventStore setup may reveal package-version or database lifecycle issues; if so, resolve them before adding live delivery-provider integration.
  - The shared-scenario/two-runner approach is new to this project and may need folder/test-runner refinement.
  - The minimal membership model may need to evolve soon to include active/lapsed membership state, households, renewals, privacy preferences, and unsubscribe/compliance rules.
  - Future notification channels may require changing delivery-channel fields and provider abstractions; ADR 0005 says to keep the shape channel-neutral where practical.
  - The next slice should integrate Postmark end to end: real sending, webhooks, tracking pixel, and a manual demo script using Gmail, Outlook/Hotmail, and other test inboxes.

You are Claude Opus acting as the repair coordinator for an iteration plan validation loop.

Use the plan text and the three independent model reviews in context:

- Gemini review
- Claude review
- Codex/GPT review

Your job in this stage is to decide whether the plan is ready, needs only obvious editorial/structural correction, or needs human product/technical decisions before it can be ready.

Readiness standard:

A plan is READY only if an engineer can begin implementation without first resolving material product/business decisions or material technical design decisions, and if a reviewer can objectively validate success at the end.

A plan is NOT READY if any of these are true:

- The goal is materially ambiguous.
- The scope is too broad or lacks a smallest useful slice.
- Acceptance criteria are not concrete/testable enough.
- Important business decisions remain open.
- Implementation steps require major technical choices that are not made.
- The expected new capability or success validation is unclear.

Correction policy:

Codex may only be asked to make obvious plan edits that do not require judgment calls, such as:

- tightening wording without changing meaning
- reorganizing existing content into clearer sections
- turning already-stated expectations into objective acceptance criteria
- making implicit boundaries explicit when the plan already clearly implies them
- removing duplication or contradiction when the intended meaning is obvious

Do not ask Codex to invent product policy, scope, UX, domain, data-model, integration, or technical-design decisions. If the plan needs those decisions, fail the validation and raise them for Matt.

Synthesis instructions:

1. Compare the three reviews.
2. Identify consensus findings.
3. Correct reviewer findings that are wrong, too vague, duplicated, or not actually blocking.
4. Decide whether the plan is already ready, needs only obvious edits, or needs Matt's input.
5. If only obvious edits are needed, produce a concrete repair brief for Codex.
6. If Matt's input is needed, do not produce a repair brief as if Codex can solve it; list the decisions/questions clearly.

Return a Markdown report with:

1. Provisional decision: READY, OBVIOUS FIXES NEEDED, or NEEDS MATT
2. Consensus findings: 3-6 bullets
3. Corrected findings: reviewer findings you changed, downgraded, combined, or rejected
4. Blocking gaps: numbered list, each with why it blocks implementation
5. Codex repair brief: exact instructions for obvious edits only, or "None"
6. Questions for Matt: decisions that need human input, or "None"
7. Validation checklist: what to check after any Codex update

At the end of your response, include one final JSON object for workflow routing. It must be the last thing in the response.

If the plan is already READY:

{"context_updates":{"plan_ready":true,"plan_needs_fix":false,"plan_needs_human":false}}

If the plan is NOT READY but Codex should apply only obvious fixes:

{"context_updates":{"plan_ready":false,"plan_needs_fix":true,"plan_needs_human":false}}

If the plan is NOT READY because Matt needs to answer questions or make decisions:

{"context_updates":{"plan_ready":false,"plan_needs_fix":false,"plan_needs_human":true}}
