  - A current member can post a reply to a club message; it is stored in that message's conversation and visible to other members in Memba.
  - The conversation shows the original message and its replies in posted order.
  - A reply is emailed to every current member of the club, excluding the reply's author, reusing the existing delivery-receipt machinery (so reply delivery is observable).
  - The reply email uses the shared transactional layout, standard footer, and `<club name> via Memba` sender, and preserves conversation context.
  - A person who is not a current member of the club cannot reply to its messages.
  - Reply body validation matches compose (no blank-body reply).
  - The new `@iteration-039` scenarios pass with the temporary tags removed/narrowed where the runners can execute them; existing messaging scenarios stay green.
  - `dev check` passes.
  
  ## Open Business Decisions
  
  None outstanding. Confirmed: Model C is the end state, reached in steps; 039 emails replies to all current members (interim reply-all); any current member can reply; the reply author is not emailed their own reply.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Model the conversation/reply in `Memba.Messaging`: decide whether the existing message aggregate is extended to hold replies, or a conversation concept references it; keep it event-sourced and consistent with existing commands/events.
  2. Add command(s)/event(s) for posting a reply, with authorization that the actor is a current member of the message's club, and non-blank body validation.
  3. Deliver the reply by email to every current member (excluding the author) by reusing the `send_club_message` delivery + receipt path; build the reply email on the shared transactional layout/footer with `<club> via Memba` sender and conversation context.
  4. Add/extend projector(s) and read APIs to load a conversation (root + ordered replies).
  5. Update the member message-detail LiveView/template: render the conversation and an inline reply composer (body only, inheriting the subject); keep delivery receipts available (demoting them per the sketch is acceptable but optional).
  6. Make the `@iteration-039` scenarios executable (domain steps first, then browser), removing/narrowing `@todo-*` as each runner can run them.
  7. Run `dev check`.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  - **Aggregate shape:** extend the existing message aggregate to hold replies, or introduce a conversation aggregate keyed by the root message id. Choose the option that keeps reply ordering and authorization simplest while staying consistent with `Memba.Messaging`, and that makes 040's "who follows this conversation?" a clean add.
  - Reuse vs. extend of `send_club_message`'s delivery path for reply fan-out (prefer reuse to inherit receipts and provider handling; note any interaction with iteration 038's email-handoff boundary if it has landed).
  
  These are implementation details and should not need product decisions.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Members can hold a conversation on a club message inside Memba — reply, read it in order, and the reply reaches the club by email with delivery tracking — the groundwork that 040 (opt-in follow) and 041 (reply-by-email) build on.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Domain ExUnit for reply posting, membership authorization, blank-body rejection, and conversation membership of the reply.
  - Delivery tests: a reply emails every current member except the author, reusing the receipt machinery; reply email rendering (footer, `<club> via Memba`, conversation context).
  - Projection/read tests for conversation loading (ordered replies).
  - LiveView tests for rendering the conversation and the reply composer.
  - The `@iteration-039` acceptance scenarios green with temporary tags removed/narrowed where runnable.
  - Full `dev check` before delivery is complete.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - **Interim reply-all noise.** 039 emails replies to all current members — the noisy model Memba otherwise avoids. 040 narrows this to opt-in followers and follows immediately. Coordinate release so 039 is not long-lived in production without 040, or consciously accept short-term reply-all on club messages.
  - **Model choice ripples forward.** 040 (followers get replies) and 041 (inbound threading) depend on the conversation/reply model chosen here. Keep "who is in / follows this conversation?" easy to answer so 040 is a clean narrowing rather than a rework.
  - The message-detail screen reframing (receipts → secondary) could grow; keep it minimal and record larger UI rework as follow-up.
  - **Conversation-screen design arrived as a fast-follow.** The DS wireframe `wireframes/member-conversation.html` was mocked after 039 implementation began, so align the in-flight build/review to it (it shows the final/040 follow toggle — 039 omits that). Mobile conversation layout is not yet mocked (only the pre-reply `mobile-message-detail.html`); add a mobile conversation card as a follow-up if needed.
  - Sits behind the active WIP slot and other queued iterations; this is planning ahead.

  # Implementation TODO
  
  - [x] 001 Model the conversation/reply in `Memba.Messaging`: decide whether the existing message aggregate is extended to hold replies, or a conversation concept references it; keep it event-sourced and consistent with existing commands/events.
  - [ ] 002 Add command(s)/event(s) for posting a reply, with authorization that the actor is a current member of the message's club, and non-blank body validation.
  - [ ] 003 Deliver the reply by email to every current member (excluding the author) by reusing the `send_club_message` delivery + receipt path; build the reply email on the shared transactional layout/footer with `<club> via Memba` sender and conversation context.
  - [ ] 004 Add/extend projector(s) and read APIs to load a conversation (root + ordered replies).
  - [ ] 005 Update the member message-detail LiveView/template: render the conversation and an inline reply composer (body only, inheriting the subject); keep delivery receipts available (demoting them per the sketch is acceptable but optional).
  - [ ] 006 Make the `@iteration-039` scenarios executable (domain steps first, then browser), removing/narrowing `@todo-*` as each runner can run them.
  - [ ] 007 Run `dev check`.

Validate the just-completed iteration task for `docs/iterations/039-club-message-threads-and-in-app-replies/plan.md`.

You have tool access. Use it. Decide from live repository state, not from summarized context alone. Read `/tmp/fabro-pre-validate-snapshot.md`, run `git status --short`, inspect `git diff`, inspect recent commits with `git log --oneline -5`, and read changed files as needed.

Important workflow contract: Fabro checkpoints after every node. Therefore, at validation time the just-completed task may appear either as uncommitted working-tree changes or as the latest/recent Fabro checkpoint commit on HEAD. A clean working tree is not, by itself, a failure.

Validate the task evidence, not a single storage mechanism. Prefer live working-tree diff/status when present; when the working tree is clean, corroborate the task using recent checkpoint commits and their diffs. Do not infer infrastructure faults unless live repository evidence proves the expected files or diffs are genuinely absent.

Do not rely on a selected-task temp file. Instead inspect the plan, `todo.md`, relevant ADRs, current repository diff/status, recent checkpoint diffs, test evidence, and the preceding implementation summary. Identify the completed task by the `todo.md` diff from the working tree or latest/recent checkpoint: exactly one ordinary task line should have changed from unchecked (`- [ ]`) to checked (`- [x]`) unless there is a clear plan-preserving split/reorder rationale.

## Validate

Accept the task only if all are true:

- The checked-off task is the first unchecked task that existed when the implementor started, or a clearly justified first slice after a plan-preserving split.
- The same task that was implemented has been checked off in `todo.md`.
- The task has concrete code/config/test/documentation evidence as appropriate; a todo-only change is invalid.
- The work stays within the approved plan and preserves plan-required scope.
- Any todo changes split/add/reorder only to satisfy the plan; no plan-required work was deleted, weakened, or silently deferred.
- Relevant automated tests were added/updated and focused tests were run, or a justified blocker was reported.
- Accepted ADR constraints relevant to this task are respected.
- Acceptance feature files (`*.feature`, including under `acceptance-tests/`) were not edited unless the plan has a `## Allowed acceptance feature changes` section naming the exact file and allowed kind of change; any permitted edit stays within that explicit permission and preserves/validates the coverage promised by the plan.
- The task is small enough to stand independently with a useful Fabro checkpoint evidence trail.

If validation fails but the task is still clear and safe to attempt again, request a clean retry from the last successful checkpoint. Do not ask for in-place repair. Only request human input when the task, plan, or repository state is ambiguous, unsafe, repeatedly failing for the same non-transient reason, or blocked by a decision/tooling issue that another clean attempt is unlikely to solve.

## Output format

Return concise Markdown with:

### Decision
One of: **VALID**, **RETRY**, or **HUMAN_INPUT**

### Evidence
- Completed todo/check-off evidence found.
- Implementation artifacts found.
- Tests run/results found.
- ADR/plan conformance notes.

### Retry brief
Only if RETRY: exact reason the attempt was rejected from live repository evidence, plus concise guidance for the next clean attempt. The workflow will snapshot the failed working tree before resetting and trying again.

### Human input
Only if HUMAN_INPUT: exact blocker/question.

End your response with exactly one JSON object for Fabro routing, not in a code fence:

- Valid:
  {"context_updates":{"task_valid":true,"task_retry_available":false}}
- Clean retry needed:
  {"context_updates":{"task_valid":false,"task_retry_available":true}}
- Human input required:
