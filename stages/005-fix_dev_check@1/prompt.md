      - context/token tests,
      - auth email tests using Swoosh test facilities or an adapter stub,
      - controller/LiveView tests for `/auth`, callback, sign out, home page variants, admin access, and member authorization.
  11. Update operational documentation for auth Postmark environment variables and the required message stream.
  12. Run `bin/dev check` and fix regressions.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  - Exact module name: prefer `Memba.Accounts` if following Phoenix convention, or `Memba.Identity` if we want to avoid implying full account management.
  - Exact callback route under `/auth`: choose the clearest route during implementation, keeping the sign-in form at `/auth`.
  - Exact Swoosh/Postmark option for message streams. Confirm adapter support; if insufficient, use Req against Postmark directly for auth emails while still following the project rule to use Req for HTTP.
  - Whether to persist staff identities. Staff authorization can be derived from email alone, but an identity row may still be useful for token/session audit.
  - Whether unauthenticated access to protected routes redirects to `/auth` with a return path. Prefer preserving the originally requested path, including `club_id`, where safe.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  People can authenticate with Memba using only their email address. The app can distinguish staff access from club membership access after sign-in, support people with multiple clubs, and support people who are both staff and members.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `bin/dev check`.
  - Automated tests should prove:
    - token hashes are stored, not plaintext tokens,
    - tokens expire,
    - tokens are single-use,
    - valid token consumption creates a browser session,
    - `/auth` does not reveal whether an email is known,
    - auth emails are constructed with the configured sender/stream and correct callback URL,
    - signed-in home page lists all clubs for an active member email,
    - staff see an Admin link,
    - staff can access `/admin/*`,
    - non-staff cannot access `/admin/*`,
    - membership checks enforce `club_id` access,
    - the Postmark webhook route is unchanged.
  - Manual demo:
    1. Configure auth email Postmark settings in a controlled environment.
    2. Create a club and add a member with a real test email.
    3. Visit `/auth`, submit the email, receive the magic link, and follow it.
    4. Confirm `/` shows that member's club.
    5. Add the same email to a second club and confirm both clubs appear.
    6. Sign in with a `memba.io` address and confirm the Admin link appears and `/admin/*` is accessible.
    7. Confirm a non-staff member cannot access `/admin/*`.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Email-domain-only staff authorization is intentionally simple; later production hardening may require explicit staff records, MFA, or allow-lists.
  - Magic links sent through email inherit email account security risks; this is acceptable for the first product slice but should be revisited if admin capabilities become more sensitive.
  - Auth email deliverability may need a dedicated Postmark stream, template, and monitored sender reputation.
  - Club-domain sign-in and club-branded auth emails remain important follow-ups.
  - Query-string `club_id` is temporary and should be replaced by host/domain club resolution when custom domains are implemented.

The preceding Run Dev Check stage failed while implementing docs/iterations/010-shared-magic-link-auth/plan.md.

This is the automated-test feedback loop for the implementation. Use the dev check output and current working tree to fix the failures until the full automated suite can pass. Stay within the iteration scope.

Rules:

- Prefer the smallest correct fix.
- Do not skip or weaken tests, checks, Credo rules, formatter rules, or compiler warnings unless the plan explicitly says to change them.
- Never edit acceptance feature files (`*.feature`, including files under `acceptance-tests/`). Treat them as locked acceptance criteria; if they appear wrong, report the blocker instead of changing them.
- Do not add unrelated cleanup.
- Re-read relevant project guidance before touching Phoenix, LiveView, HEEx, Ecto, or Elixir test code.
- Do not commit changes.
- **Sandbox/runtime boundary**: If the failure appears caused by sandbox/toolchain/runtime incoherence (stale `/env` paths, unwritable caches, missing tools, broken services, stale process-compose state), stop and report a sandbox blocker. Do not patch `bin/dev`, application scripts, product code, dependencies, or tests merely to compensate for sandbox runtime defects.
- **If no changes were needed**: If after reviewing the failures you determine that no code/config/test changes are required, state that explicitly and provide clear justification for why the dev check failures do not require changes.

When finished, summarize:

1. Each dev check failure from the preceding stage.
2. The concrete code/config/test changes made for each failure (or an explicit statement that no changes were needed with justification).
3. Files changed (grouped by failure addressed).
4. Tests run and their results.
5. Any remaining failures or human questions.

Include a failure-to-fix mapping showing which files/modules address each dev check failure.
