  12. Restyle `/admin/deliveries` consistently without changing delivery semantics.
  13. Restyle `/admin/messages/:message_id` consistently without changing diagnostics semantics.
  14. Update or add LiveView tests for:
      - staff nav links;
      - `/admin/people` read-only list and multi-club membership summary;
      - `/admin/messages` read-only list and diagnostics links;
      - absence of staff-side send-message affordance;
      - preservation of existing club/person/membership workflows.
  15. Update acceptance step support and remove the feature-level `@wip` tag from `memba_staff_operations.feature` once its scenarios pass.
  16. Run targeted tests for admin LiveViews and acceptance configuration.
  17. Run `dev check`.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  Implementation should investigate and decide:
  
  - The best query shape for global People membership summaries without introducing expensive N+1 behaviour.
  - Whether global People rows can safely link to an existing club-scoped person edit route when a person has multiple memberships; if ambiguous, keep the page read-only and defer global edit semantics.
  - The best query shape for global Messages sender and club context, given current projections only store IDs on `messaging_messages`.
  - How much of the mockup’s KPI/header treatment can be implemented from existing data without inventing unsupported operational metrics.
  - Whether shared admin UI helper components should be extracted during the redesign, or whether duplication is preferable for this slice.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Memba staff have a clearer operations area that shows the real domain model: clubs, people, memberships, messages, and delivery diagnostics are easier to find and no longer mixed with staff-side message composition.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Review the implemented pages against the mockups for staff-operations feel, while checking that domain language remains honest.
  - Run LiveView tests for the new People and Messages pages and updated admin pages.
  - Run affected acceptance scenarios after implementation removes `@wip` tags.
  - Run acceptance configuration checks while scenarios are still `@wip` during planning.
  - Run `dev check` before delivery is complete.
  - Manual demo:
    1. Sign in as Memba staff.
    2. Confirm staff nav shows Clubs, People, Messages, Deliveries only.
    3. Open Clubs and create or inspect a club.
    4. Open a club and confirm club facts, people, and memberships are distinct.
    5. Confirm no staff-side send club message form exists.
    6. Open People and confirm a person with multiple club memberships is represented as one person with multiple memberships.
    7. Open Messages and open a message diagnostics page.
    8. Open Deliveries and confirm existing diagnostics remain visible.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - The mockups imply several future behaviours that should not sneak into this slice; see `follow-ups.md`.
  - Global People edit routing may be ambiguous for people with multiple memberships; do not invent a global edit workflow unless it remains small and safe.
  - Global Messages may need sender/club enrichment not currently projected directly; keep the read model simple and avoid large projection redesign unless necessary.
  - Removing the staff composer may require updating browser acceptance helpers that currently click “Send club message” through staff club pages; implementation should move those helpers to member compose flows or direct domain setup as appropriate.
  - `docs/iterations/020-migrate-production-email-to-postmark` is still marked `implementing` in the iteration index; delivery of this plan should wait until the implementation WIP slot is free.

The preceding Run Dev Check stage failed while implementing docs/iterations/021-staff-area-redesign/plan.md.

This is the automated-test feedback loop for the implementation. Use the dev check output and current working tree to fix the failures until the full automated suite can pass. Stay within the iteration scope.

Rules:

- Prefer the smallest correct fix.
- Do not skip or weaken tests, checks, Credo rules, formatter rules, or compiler warnings unless the plan explicitly says to change them.
- Never edit acceptance feature files (`*.feature`, including files under `acceptance-tests/`). Treat them as locked acceptance criteria; if they appear wrong, report the blocker instead of changing them.
- Do not add unrelated cleanup.
- Re-read relevant project guidance before touching Phoenix, LiveView, HEEx, Ecto, or Elixir test code.
- Do not commit changes.
- **Sandbox/runtime boundary**: If the failure appears caused by sandbox/toolchain/runtime incoherence (stale `/env` paths, unwritable caches, missing tools, broken services, stale process-compose state), stop and report a sandbox blocker. Do not patch `bin/dev`, application scripts, product code, dependencies, or tests merely to compensate for sandbox runtime defects.
- **If no changes were needed**: If after reviewing the failures you determine that no code/config/test changes are required, state that explicitly and provide clear justification for why the dev check failures do not require changes.

When finished, summarize:

1. Each dev check failure from the preceding stage.
2. The concrete code/config/test changes made for each failure (or an explicit statement that no changes were needed with justification).
3. Files changed (grouped by failure addressed).
4. Tests run and their results.
5. Any remaining failures or human questions.

Include a failure-to-fix mapping showing which files/modules address each dev check failure.
