- Script: `PLAN_PATH='docs/iterations/011-member-facing-message-behaviour/plan.md'
if [ ! -f "$PLAN_PATH" ]; then
  echo "Iteration plan not found: $PLAN_PATH" >&2

  3. Update member step definitions so:
     - `When Alice sends...` uses Alice's member session and the club-home send flow;
     - `When Alice/Bob views...` uses that member's session and `GET /messages/:message_id?club_id=<club_id>`;
     - receipt assertions read member-facing recipient rows, labels, and icons.
  4. Build/refine member club home at `GET /?club_id=<club_id>`:
     - recent messages link to member message detail;
     - active members summary/list;
     - inline compose form/action based on the wireframe's compose design.
  5. Add member message detail at `GET /messages/:message_id?club_id=<club_id>`:
     - authorize active membership for the `club_id` query param;
     - ensure the message belongs to that club;
     - apply existing failure conventions:
       - unauthenticated access redirects to `/auth` and preserves return path;
       - signed-in non-members/inactive members for `club_id` get forbidden;
       - message/club mismatch responds not found;
       - failure paths do not expose message content or operator-only diagnostics;
     - show subject, body, sender, and addressed members with grouped receipt statuses and stable recipient rows.
  6. Add a presentation mapping for member receipt labels and Heroicons without changing internal projection values.
  7. Keep staff/admin diagnostics unchanged on `/admin/messages/:message_id` and `/admin/deliveries`.
  8. Add focused tests for member route authorization, message-club ownership checks, status label/icon mapping, and no operator-only fields on member pages.
  9. Remove `@wip` from `member_message_deliverability.feature` when browser scenarios pass.
  10. Run `dev check`.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  None known. Route shape, compose placement, receipt display, and icon source are decided in Scope and Implementation Plan.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Memba can prove member-message behaviour through the actual member experience. Members can send a club message and inspect member-friendly receipts for everyone addressed, while detailed deliverability diagnostics remain staff/operator-only.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `dev check`.
  - Browser Cucumber passes with `member_message_deliverability.feature` untagged.
  - Targeted browser evidence proves:
    - setup may use staff/admin routes;
    - Alice sends from an authenticated member session;
    - Alice/Bob view receipt statuses from authenticated member sessions;
    - member assertions do not navigate to `/admin/*`.
  - Phoenix tests cover member route authorization, message-club ownership, status label/icon mapping, and member detail rendering without operator-only fields.
  - Manual demo script: `docs/iterations/011-member-facing-message-behaviour/manual-demo-script.md`.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Existing acceptance support is staff-harness-heavy; separating setup from member assertions may reveal coupling.
  - Query-string `club_id` remains temporary until custom domains exist.
  - The member-facing receipt policy may later need role controls if clubs consider receipts sensitive.
  - The sender-included rule is provisional.
  - The design reference is richer than this slice; avoid unrelated features.

Validate the just-completed iteration task for `docs/iterations/011-member-facing-message-behaviour/plan.md`.

You have tool access. Use it. Decide from live repository state, not from summarized context alone. Read `/tmp/fabro-pre-validate-snapshot.md`, run `git status --short`, inspect `git diff`, inspect recent commits with `git log --oneline -5`, and read changed files as needed.

Important workflow contract: Fabro checkpoints after every node. Therefore, at validation time the just-completed task may appear either as uncommitted working-tree changes or as the latest/recent Fabro checkpoint commit on HEAD. A clean working tree is not, by itself, a failure.

Validate the task evidence, not a single storage mechanism. Prefer live working-tree diff/status when present; when the working tree is clean, corroborate the task using recent checkpoint commits and their diffs. Do not infer infrastructure faults unless live repository evidence proves the expected files or diffs are genuinely absent.

Do not rely on a selected-task temp file. Instead inspect the plan, `todo.md`, relevant ADRs, current repository diff/status, recent checkpoint diffs, test evidence, and the preceding implementation summary. Identify the completed task by the `todo.md` diff from the working tree or latest/recent checkpoint: exactly one ordinary task line should have changed from unchecked (`- [ ]`) to checked (`- [x]`) unless there is a clear plan-preserving split/reorder rationale.

## Validate

Accept the task only if all are true:

- The checked-off task is the first unchecked task that existed when the implementor started, or a clearly justified first slice after a plan-preserving split.
- The same task that was implemented has been checked off in `todo.md`.
- The task has concrete code/config/test/documentation evidence as appropriate; a todo-only change is invalid.
- The work stays within the approved plan and preserves plan-required scope.
- Any todo changes split/add/reorder only to satisfy the plan; no plan-required work was deleted, weakened, or silently deferred.
- Relevant automated tests were added/updated and focused tests were run, or a justified blocker was reported.
- Accepted ADR constraints relevant to this task are respected.
- Acceptance feature files (`*.feature`, including under `acceptance-tests/`) were not edited unless the plan has a `## Allowed acceptance feature changes` section naming the exact file and allowed kind of change; any permitted edit stays within that explicit permission and preserves/validates the coverage promised by the plan.
- The task is small enough to stand independently with a useful Fabro checkpoint evidence trail.

If validation fails but the task is still clear and safe to attempt again, request a clean retry from the last successful checkpoint. Do not ask for in-place repair. Only request human input when the task, plan, or repository state is ambiguous, unsafe, repeatedly failing for the same non-transient reason, or blocked by a decision/tooling issue that another clean attempt is unlikely to solve.

## Output format

Return concise Markdown with:

### Decision
One of: **VALID**, **RETRY**, or **HUMAN_INPUT**

### Evidence
- Completed todo/check-off evidence found.
- Implementation artifacts found.
- Tests run/results found.
- ADR/plan conformance notes.

### Retry brief
Only if RETRY: exact reason the attempt was rejected from live repository evidence, plus concise guidance for the next clean attempt. The workflow will snapshot the failed working tree before resetting and trying again.

### Human input
Only if HUMAN_INPUT: exact blocker/question.

End your response with exactly one JSON object for Fabro routing, not in a code fence:

- Valid:
  {"context_updates":{"task_valid":true,"task_retry_available":false}}
- Clean retry needed:
  {"context_updates":{"task_valid":false,"task_retry_available":true}}
- Human input required:
