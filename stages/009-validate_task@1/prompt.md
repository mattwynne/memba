## Stage: read_plan
- Status: succeeded
- Handler: command
- Script: `PLAN_PATH='docs/iterations/003-messaging-skeleton/plan.md'

  echo "Iteration plan not found: $PLAN_PATH" >&2
  exit 1

  - Cucumber step definitions for the scenario "A member sends a club
    message", including the assertions about who is and is not addressed and
    the per-recipient provider calls.
  - ExUnit coverage for the Message aggregate rules and the fake provider
    port.
  
  ### Out of scope
  
  - Delivery status transitions beyond `sent`.
  - Member-facing receipt status mapping (ADR 0006).
  - Operator deliverability view.
  - Open tracking and idempotency (ADR 0012).
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  
  - Sending a message to a club addresses exactly the active members of that
    club, and does not address members of other clubs.
  - One recipient delivery record exists per resolved recipient.
  - The fake provider port is called exactly once per recipient delivery.
  - The Cucumber scenario "A member sends a club message" passes.
  - ExUnit covers Message aggregate decisions, the application service's
    recipient resolution, and the fake provider port.
  - `devenv shell mix precommit` passes.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Add `Memba.Messaging.App` and `Memba.Messaging.Router`.
  2. Add the `Message` aggregate, `SendMessage` command, and `MessageSent` +
     per-recipient delivery events.
  3. Add the application service that resolves recipients via Membership and
     dispatches `SendMessage`.
  4. Define the fake delivery provider port and wire it into the message
     sending flow so it is called once per recipient.
  5. Add projections and queries for messages and recipient deliveries.
  6. Add Cucumber step definitions for "A member sends a club message".
  7. Run `devenv shell mix precommit` and fix any issues.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Cucumber scenario for sending a club message passes.
  - ExUnit covers aggregate rules, application service, and fake provider.
  - `devenv shell mix precommit` passes.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - The fake provider shape needs to be channel-neutral enough that ADR 0005
    remains satisfied when a real provider (likely Postmark) lands in a later
    iteration.
  - Iteration 004 adds the delivery status state machine, receipt mapping, and
    operator views.

- Response:
  > 1. **Selected todo line**
  >    - `- [ ] 001 Add Memba.Messaging.App and Memba.Messaging.Router.`
  > 
  > 2. **Changes made**
  >    - Added `Memba.Messaging.App` as a separate Commanded application.
  >    - Added `Memba.Messaging.Router` as the Messaging command router.
  >    - Added `Memba.Messaging.EventStore` so the separate Messaging Commanded context can run without conflicting with the existing Membership EventStore process.
  >    - Wired `Memba.Messaging.App` into the Phoenix supervision tree.
  >    - Configured Messaging Commanded/EventStore settings for dev, test, and prod runtime.
  >    - Added focused tests for:
  >      - Messaging app supervision.
  >      - Messaging router registration.
  >      - Dispatch through the Messaging app/router.
  >      - Messaging Commanded/EventStore configuration.
  > 
  > 3. **Validation run**
  >    - `cd web && mix compile --warnings-as-errors` — passed.
  >    - `cd web && MIX_ENV=test mix compile --force --warnings-as-errors` — passed.
  >    - `PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH" dev check` — passed:
  >      - `58 tests, 0 failures`
  >      - command exited successfully.
  > 
  >    Notes:
  >    - An initial direct `mix test` attempt failed because Postgres was not running outside `dev`.
  >    - An initial `dev check` exposed an EventStore process-name conflict; this was fixed by giving Messaging its own EventStore module configured to the same dedicated EventStore schema.
  > 
  > 4. **Todo check-off made**
  >    - Changed exactly:
  >      - `- [ ] 001 Add Memba.Messaging.App and Memba.Messaging.Router.`
  >    - To:
  >      - `- [x] 001 Add Memba.Messaging.App and Memba.Messaging.Router.`
  > 
  > 5. **Todo splits/additions/reordering**
  >    - None.
  > 
  > 6. **ADR conformance evidence**
  >    - ADR 0007: Implemented a separate Messaging Commanded context with `Memba.Messaging.App` and `Memba.Messaging.Router`.
  >    - ADR 0008: Messaging uses the persistent Postgres EventStore path and the same dedicated `event_store` schema configuration pattern.
  >    - ADR 0004 / ADR 0005 / ADR 0011: No aggregate, command, recipient resolution, or identity behavior was added in this task, so those later requirements remain untouched for subsequent todo items.

Validate the just-completed iteration task for `docs/iterations/003-messaging-skeleton/plan.md`.

You have tool access. Use it. Decide from live repository state, not from summarized context alone. Read `/tmp/fabro-pre-validate-snapshot.md`, run `git status --short`, inspect `git diff`, inspect recent commits with `git log --oneline -5`, and read changed files as needed.

Important workflow contract: Fabro checkpoints after every node. Therefore, at validation time the just-completed task may appear either as uncommitted working-tree changes or as the latest/recent Fabro checkpoint commit on HEAD. A clean working tree is not, by itself, a failure.

Validate the task evidence, not a single storage mechanism. Prefer live working-tree diff/status when present; when the working tree is clean, corroborate the task using recent checkpoint commits and their diffs. Do not infer infrastructure faults unless live repository evidence proves the expected files or diffs are genuinely absent.

Do not rely on a selected-task temp file. Instead inspect the plan, `todo.md`, relevant ADRs, current repository diff/status, recent checkpoint diffs, test evidence, and the preceding implementation summary. Identify the completed task by the `todo.md` diff from the working tree or latest/recent checkpoint: exactly one ordinary task line should have changed from unchecked (`- [ ]`) to checked (`- [x]`) unless there is a clear plan-preserving split/reorder rationale.

## Validate

Accept the task only if all are true:

- The checked-off task is the first unchecked task that existed when the implementor started, or a clearly justified first slice after a plan-preserving split.
- The same task that was implemented has been checked off in `todo.md`.
- The task has concrete code/config/test/documentation evidence as appropriate; a todo-only change is invalid.
- The work stays within the approved plan and preserves plan-required scope.
- Any todo changes split/add/reorder only to satisfy the plan; no plan-required work was deleted, weakened, or silently deferred.
- Relevant automated tests were added/updated and focused tests were run, or a justified blocker was reported.
- Accepted ADR constraints relevant to this task are respected.
- No acceptance feature files (`*.feature`, including under `acceptance-tests/`) were edited.
- The task is small enough to stand independently with a useful Fabro checkpoint evidence trail.

If validation fails but the task is still clear and safe to attempt again, request a clean retry from the last successful checkpoint. Do not ask for in-place repair. Only request human input when the task, plan, or repository state is ambiguous, unsafe, repeatedly failing for the same non-transient reason, or blocked by a decision/tooling issue that another clean attempt is unlikely to solve.

## Output format

Return concise Markdown with:

### Decision
One of: **VALID**, **RETRY**, or **HUMAN_INPUT**

### Evidence
- Completed todo/check-off evidence found.
- Implementation artifacts found.
- Tests run/results found.
- ADR/plan conformance notes.

### Retry brief
Only if RETRY: exact reason the attempt was rejected from live repository evidence, plus concise guidance for the next clean attempt. The workflow will snapshot the failed working tree before resetting and trying again.

### Human input
Only if HUMAN_INPUT: exact blocker/question.

End your response with exactly one JSON object for Fabro routing, not in a code fence:

- Valid:
  {"context_updates":{"task_valid":true,"task_retry_available":false}}
- Clean retry needed:
  {"context_updates":{"task_valid":false,"task_retry_available":true}}
- Human input required:
  {"context_updates":{"task_valid":false,"task_retry_available":false}}
