  (102 lines omitted)
     - `ClubsLive.Index` → `Admin.ClubsLive.Index`.
     - `ClubsLive.Show` → `Admin.ClubsLive.Show`.
     - `MessagesLive.Show` → `Admin.MessagesLive.Show`.
     - `DeliveriesLive.Index` → `Admin.DeliveriesLive.Index`.
  3. Update all internal verified routes and links:
     - Club list/detail links should use `/admin/clubs` and `/admin/clubs/:club_id`.
     - Message diagnostic links should use `/admin/messages/:message_id`.
     - Delivery overview links should use `/admin/deliveries`.
  4. Add or adjust layout functions in `MembaWeb.Layouts`:
     - Keep a Memba-branded public/app layout for marketing/legal pages.
     - Add an admin layout for staff pages, with utilitarian Memba chrome.
     - Add a club-site layout seam for future white-label pages using CSS custom properties with a neutral slate default, but do not wire fake club routing into production routes.
  5. Update the homepage links and labels so the primary operational link points to `/admin/clubs` if retained, or is presented as an internal/admin link rather than a public user journey.
  6. Update controller and LiveView tests to assert the new paths.
  7. Add route tests asserting old harness paths return 404 (not redirects).
  8. Run `bin/dev check` and fix any route/module/test failures.
  
  ## Technical Decisions
  
  - Physically move LiveView files into `web/lib/memba_web/live/admin/...` to match module names.
  - Introduce a `:staff_browser` pipeline now for future staff auth; it should currently delegate to `:browser`-equivalent plugs as an obvious auth insertion point.
  - Implement a real `Layouts.club_site` layout seam with default theme assigns (rather than a placeholder module/component).
  
  ## New Capability
  
  The application will have a clean routing and module structure that reflects the product's three surfaces. Staff tools will no longer masquerade as public pages, and future club-member work can start from a named white-label surface instead of extracting behaviour from the harness.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `bin/dev check`.
  - Automated route/controller/LiveView tests should cover:
    - public pages still work,
    - admin routes render the moved pages,
    - old harness routes return 404 (no redirects),
    - Postmark webhook route remains available.
  - Manual smoke test:
    1. Open `/` and confirm public homepage renders.
    2. Open `/admin/clubs`, create a club, and open its detail page.
    3. Add or view members on `/admin/clubs/:club_id`.
    4. Send or inspect a message if test data is available.
    5. Open `/admin/messages/:message_id` and confirm diagnostics are staff-facing.
    6. Open `/admin/deliveries` and confirm the operator overview renders.
    7. Confirm `/clubs` returns the normal 404 page (and does not render the club list).
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - This does not provide real security for `/admin/*`; staff auth must be a later slice before real users or sensitive data are present.
  - The member-facing white-label routes are intentionally not exposed yet. The next member-facing slice should start with real club resolution and/or magic-link auth rather than temporary URL hacks.
  - Moving modules can break tests that refer to route paths, DOM IDs, or module names; keep DOM IDs stable where acceptance tests depend on them.
  - The existing `ClubsLive.Show` still mixes add-member, send-message, and message list responsibilities. Further extraction should happen when member-facing noticeboard/compose pages are implemented.

  > # Independent Plan Review
  > 
  > ## Decision: READY
  > 
  > ## Confidence: High
  > 
  > ## Blocking Gaps
  > 
  > None.
  > 
  > ## Non-blocking Improvements
  > 
  > 1. **Step 5 could be more decisive about homepage links**: Currently says "if retained" which gives implementer discretion. Consider being more explicit: either "Remove the clubs link from homepage" or "Update homepage link to `/admin/clubs` and label it 'Admin Tools' or 'Staff Access'".
  > 
  > 2. **Goal statement could articulate benefit more clearly**: Consider rephrasing to "...enabling clear separation of concerns for future authentication, authorization, and white-label customization work" to make the downstream value more explicit.
  > 
  > 3. **Acceptance criterion 7 could specify CSS custom property names**: "Neutral default theme" is clarified in technical decisions but could be even more specific (e.g., "using CSS custom properties `--club-primary`, `--club-secondary`, etc. with neutral slate defaults").
  > 
  > ## Smallest Viable Iteration
  > 
  > The current plan is already close to minimal. You could theoretically defer:
  > - The `:staff_browser` pipeline (add when implementing actual auth)
  > - The `Layouts.club_site` layout seam (add when implementing member routes)
  > 
  > However, both are small scaffolding additions with clear future value and minimal cost. The current scope is appropriate and focused.
  > 
  > **Recommendation**: Proceed with the plan as written. It's already scoped to pure structural changes with no new features or auth implementation.
  > 
  > ## Required Plan Edits
  > 
  > None. The minor improvements listed above are non-blocking suggestions for clarity, not required changes.
  > 
  > ## Validation Plan Assessment
  > 
  > The existing validation plan is comprehensive and well-structured:
  > 
  > **Automated validation:**
  > - `bin/dev check` ensures code quality and test passage
  > - Route tests verify admin routes work and old routes return 404
  > - Controller and LiveView tests verify moved pages render correctly
  > - Webhook route test ensures integration point remains intact
  > 
  > **Manual validation:**
  > Seven specific smoke test steps covering:
  > - Public surface (homepage)
  > - Admin surface (clubs, members, messages, deliveries)
  > - Edge case verification (old routes return 404, not redirects)
  > 
  > **Acceptance criteria:**
  > All eight criteria are concrete, objectively testable, and comprehensive:
  > - Route structure (criteria 1-4)
  > - Module naming (criterion 5)
  > - Infrastructure scaffolding (criteria 6-7)
  > - Quality gate (criterion 8)
  > 
  > **Stop condition:** Clear - all acceptance criteria met and validation passes.
  > 
  > **How to prove success:**
  > 1. Run automated tests (including new route tests)
  > 2. Execute manual smoke test
  > 3. Verify old harness paths return proper 404s
  > 4. Confirm all moved admin pages render and function
  > 5. Verify public pages and webhook route unaffected
  > 
  > The validation plan adequately covers happy paths, important edge cases (404 behavior), integration points (webhook), and provides clear pass/fail criteria.

You are Claude Opus acting as the repair coordinator for an iteration plan validation loop.

Use the plan text and the three model reviews in context.

The reviewer stages must have exposed both their Markdown reports and these routing context fields. The reviewers run as separate model-review stages so these fields are visible to synthesis:

- Gemini: `gemini_review_decision`, `gemini_review_confidence`, `gemini_review_blocking_gap_count`, `gemini_review_blocking_gaps`, `gemini_review_required_edits`
- Claude: `claude_review_decision`, `claude_review_confidence`, `claude_review_blocking_gap_count`, `claude_review_blocking_gaps`, `claude_review_required_edits`
- Codex/GPT: `codex_review_decision`, `codex_review_confidence`, `codex_review_blocking_gap_count`, `codex_review_blocking_gaps`, `codex_review_required_edits`

Fail closed if you cannot see all three reviewer decisions and blocking-gap summaries. Missing reviewer evidence is a workflow/tooling failure for this validation pass, not proof that the plan is ready.

Your job in this stage is to decide whether the plan is ready, needs only obvious editorial/structural correction, or needs human product/technical decisions before it can be ready.

Readiness standard:

A plan is READY only if an engineer can begin implementation without first resolving material product/business decisions or material technical design decisions, and if a reviewer can objectively validate success at the end.

A plan is NOT READY if any of these are true:

- The goal is materially ambiguous.
- The scope is too broad or lacks a smallest useful slice.
- Acceptance criteria are not concrete/testable enough.
- Important business decisions remain open.
- Implementation steps require major technical choices that are not made.
- The expected new capability or success validation is unclear.
- The plan expects shared acceptance `.feature` file edits but lacks a `## Allowed acceptance feature changes` section naming each exact file, the allowed kind of change, the reason, and how coverage is preserved or intentionally changed.

Correction policy:

Codex may only be asked to make obvious plan edits that do not require judgment calls, such as:

- tightening wording without changing meaning
- reorganizing existing content into clearer sections
- turning already-stated expectations into objective acceptance criteria
- making implicit boundaries explicit when the plan already clearly implies them
- removing duplication or contradiction when the intended meaning is obvious

Do not ask Codex to invent product policy, scope, UX, domain, data-model, integration, or technical-design decisions. If the plan needs those decisions, fail the validation and raise them for Matt.

Synthesis instructions:

1. First verify that all three reviewer decisions and blocking-gap summaries are visible in context. If any are missing, route to Matt/human input and explain that validation evidence was incomplete.
2. Compare the three reviews.
3. Include a reviewer decision table with each reviewer's decision, confidence, blocking gap count, and notes.
4. Identify consensus findings.
5. Correct reviewer findings that are wrong, too vague, duplicated, or not actually blocking.
6. Decide whether the plan is already ready, needs only obvious edits, or needs Matt's input.
7. If only obvious edits are needed, produce a concrete repair brief for Codex.
8. If Matt's input is needed, do not produce a repair brief as if Codex can solve it; list the decisions/questions clearly.

Voting/consensus guardrails:

- If two or more reviewers say NOT READY, you must not publish READY unless you explicitly quote or summarize each NOT READY blocker and explain why it is wrong or non-blocking.
- If any reviewer says NOT READY, include a `Reviewer objections addressed` section that accounts for every blocking gap from that reviewer.
- Do not treat successful reviewer node execution as readiness. Only the reviewer decision and findings content can support readiness.
- If your response cannot include a real synthesis report with the sections below, route to Matt/human input rather than READY.

Return a Markdown report with:

1. Provisional decision: READY, OBVIOUS FIXES NEEDED, or NEEDS MATT
2. Reviewer decision table: Reviewer, Decision, Confidence, Blocking gaps count, Notes
3. Consensus findings: 3-6 bullets
4. Reviewer objections addressed: account for every NOT READY blocking gap, or "No reviewer returned NOT READY"
5. Corrected findings: reviewer findings you changed, downgraded, combined, or rejected
6. Blocking gaps: numbered list, each with why it blocks implementation
7. Codex repair brief: exact instructions for obvious edits only, or "None"
8. Questions for Matt: decisions that need human input, or "None"
9. Validation checklist: what to check after any Codex update

At the end of your response, include one final JSON object for workflow routing. It must be the last thing in the response.

If the plan is already READY:

{"context_updates":{"plan_ready":true,"plan_needs_fix":false,"plan_needs_human":false}}

If the plan is NOT READY but Codex should apply only obvious fixes:

{"context_updates":{"plan_ready":false,"plan_needs_fix":true,"plan_needs_human":false}}

If the plan is NOT READY because Matt needs to answer questions or make decisions:

{"context_updates":{"plan_ready":false,"plan_needs_fix":false,"plan_needs_human":true}}
