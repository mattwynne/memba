      - context/token tests,
      - auth email tests using Swoosh test facilities or an adapter stub,
      - controller/LiveView tests for `/auth`, callback, sign out, home page variants, admin access, and member authorization.
  11. Update operational documentation for auth Postmark environment variables and the required message stream.
  12. Run `bin/dev check` and fix regressions.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  - Exact module name: prefer `Memba.Accounts` if following Phoenix convention, or `Memba.Identity` if we want to avoid implying full account management.
  - Exact callback route under `/auth`: choose the clearest route during implementation, keeping the sign-in form at `/auth`.
  - Exact Swoosh/Postmark option for message streams. Confirm adapter support; if insufficient, use Req against Postmark directly for auth emails while still following the project rule to use Req for HTTP.
  - Whether to persist staff identities. Staff authorization can be derived from email alone, but an identity row may still be useful for token/session audit.
  - Whether unauthenticated access to protected routes redirects to `/auth` with a return path. Prefer preserving the originally requested path, including `club_id`, where safe.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  People can authenticate with Memba using only their email address. The app can distinguish staff access from club membership access after sign-in, support people with multiple clubs, and support people who are both staff and members.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `bin/dev check`.
  - Automated tests should prove:
    - token hashes are stored, not plaintext tokens,
    - tokens expire,
    - tokens are single-use,
    - valid token consumption creates a browser session,
    - `/auth` does not reveal whether an email is known,
    - auth emails are constructed with the configured sender/stream and correct callback URL,
    - signed-in home page lists all clubs for an active member email,
    - staff see an Admin link,
    - staff can access `/admin/*`,
    - non-staff cannot access `/admin/*`,
    - membership checks enforce `club_id` access,
    - the Postmark webhook route is unchanged.
  - Manual demo:
    1. Configure auth email Postmark settings in a controlled environment.
    2. Create a club and add a member with a real test email.
    3. Visit `/auth`, submit the email, receive the magic link, and follow it.
    4. Confirm `/` shows that member's club.
    5. Add the same email to a second club and confirm both clubs appear.
    6. Sign in with a `memba.io` address and confirm the Admin link appears and `/admin/*` is accessible.
    7. Confirm a non-staff member cannot access `/admin/*`.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Email-domain-only staff authorization is intentionally simple; later production hardening may require explicit staff records, MFA, or allow-lists.
  - Magic links sent through email inherit email account security risks; this is acceptable for the first product slice but should be revisited if admin capabilities become more sensitive.
  - Auth email deliverability may need a dedicated Postmark stream, template, and monitored sender reputation.
  - Club-domain sign-in and club-branded auth emails remain important follow-ups.
  - Query-string `club_id` is temporary and should be replaced by host/domain club resolution when custom domains are implemented.

  > # Iteration Plan Review: Shared Magic Link Authentication
  > 
  > ## Decision: READY
  > 
  > ## Confidence: Medium
  > 
  > ## Blocking gaps
  > 
  > None.
  > 
  > ## Non-blocking improvements
  > 
  > 1. **Move security requirement to acceptance criteria**: The validation plan tests that "/auth does not reveal whether an email is known," but this security requirement should be an explicit acceptance criterion, not just a test assertion.
  > 
  > 2. **Add acceptance criterion for unauthenticated access**: Currently listed as an open decision, but the user-facing behavior for unauthenticated access to protected routes should be in acceptance criteria. The plan states a preference ("Prefer preserving the originally requested path"), which provides implementation guidance, but this should be formalized.
  > 
  > 3. **Add acceptance criteria for token error states**: The validation plan tests expired tokens, single-use tokens, and invalid tokens, but acceptance criteria don't specify what users see when encountering these states.
  > 
  > 4. **Specify token expiration duration**: Mentioned in implementation ("appropriate expiration") but not decided. A concrete duration (e.g., 15 minutes, 1 hour) would remove ambiguity.
  > 
  > 5. **Clarify sign-out behavior**: Not mentioned in acceptance criteria. Even if it's just "clear session," this should be explicit.
  > 
  > 6. **Decide staff identity persistence before implementation**: Currently an open decision, but choosing upfront (even if the choice is "decide during implementation based on code clarity") would be cleaner.
  > 
  > ## Smallest viable iteration
  > 
  > The current iteration is already quite focused. A smaller slice would be:
  > 
  > **Magic link authentication only**, deferring:
  > - Multiple club support (show only first club or require query param)
  > - Staff/admin distinction (all authenticated users see same view)
  > 
  > However, this would deliver limited value. The current scope is reasonable because:
  > - Multiple clubs is core to the member experience
  > - Staff/admin distinction is minimal code but important for operational access
  > - The whole iteration is bounded by a single authentication pattern
  > 
  > I recommend keeping the current scope.
  > 
  > ## Required plan edits
  > 
  > None. The plan is implementable as written. The validation plan is comprehensive and covers the user-facing behaviors not fully enumerated in acceptance criteria. Open technical decisions are appropriately deferred to implementation.
  > 
  > ## Validation plan
  > 
  > The plan includes excellent validation:
  > 
  > **Automated tests** cover:
  > - Token security (hashing, expiration, single-use)
  > - Session creation
  > - Privacy (no email enumeration)
  > - Email construction
  > - Authorization (staff vs member, admin access, club access)
  > - Webhook preservation
  > 
  > **Manual demo** covers:
  > - End-to-end magic link flow
  > - Multiple club display
  > - Staff admin access
  > - Authorization enforcement
  > 
  > **Stop condition**: Clear - when `bin/dev check` passes and all automated tests prove the documented behaviors.
  > 
  > ## Recommendations
  > 
  > 1. The iteration is well-structured and ready for implementation.
  > 
  > 2. Consider promoting the security, error-state, and redirect behaviors from validation plan to acceptance criteria for future iterations—this makes the contract clearer upfront.
  > 
  > 3. The implementer should use the stated preferences in "Open Technical Decisions" as guidance rather than blockers. For example, "prefer preserving the originally requested path" is sufficient direction.
  > 
  > 4. The validation plan is strong enough to catch any ambiguities during implementation, making this safe to proceed despite minor acceptance criteria gaps.

You are Claude Opus acting as the repair coordinator for an iteration plan validation loop.

Use the plan text and the three model reviews in context.

The reviewer stages must have exposed both their Markdown reports and these routing context fields. The reviewers run as separate model-review stages so these fields are visible to synthesis:

- Gemini: `gemini_review_decision`, `gemini_review_confidence`, `gemini_review_blocking_gap_count`, `gemini_review_blocking_gaps`, `gemini_review_required_edits`
- Claude: `claude_review_decision`, `claude_review_confidence`, `claude_review_blocking_gap_count`, `claude_review_blocking_gaps`, `claude_review_required_edits`
- Codex/GPT: `codex_review_decision`, `codex_review_confidence`, `codex_review_blocking_gap_count`, `codex_review_blocking_gaps`, `codex_review_required_edits`

Fail closed if you cannot see all three reviewer decisions and blocking-gap summaries. Missing reviewer evidence is a workflow/tooling failure for this validation pass, not proof that the plan is ready.

Your job in this stage is to decide whether the plan is ready, needs only obvious editorial/structural correction, or needs human product/technical decisions before it can be ready.

Readiness standard:

A plan is READY only if an engineer can begin implementation without first resolving material product/business decisions or material technical design decisions, and if a reviewer can objectively validate success at the end.

A plan is NOT READY if any of these are true:

- The goal is materially ambiguous.
- The scope is too broad or lacks a smallest useful slice.
- Acceptance criteria are not concrete/testable enough.
- Important business decisions remain open.
- Implementation steps require major technical choices that are not made.
- The expected new capability or success validation is unclear.
- The plan expects shared acceptance `.feature` file edits but lacks a `## Allowed acceptance feature changes` section naming each exact file, the allowed kind of change, the reason, and how coverage is preserved or intentionally changed.

Correction policy:

Codex may only be asked to make obvious plan edits that do not require judgment calls, such as:

- tightening wording without changing meaning
- reorganizing existing content into clearer sections
- turning already-stated expectations into objective acceptance criteria
- making implicit boundaries explicit when the plan already clearly implies them
- removing duplication or contradiction when the intended meaning is obvious

Do not ask Codex to invent product policy, scope, UX, domain, data-model, integration, or technical-design decisions. If the plan needs those decisions, fail the validation and raise them for Matt.

Synthesis instructions:

1. First verify that all three reviewer decisions and blocking-gap summaries are visible in context. If any are missing, route to Matt/human input and explain that validation evidence was incomplete.
2. Compare the three reviews.
3. Include a reviewer decision table with each reviewer's decision, confidence, blocking gap count, and notes.
4. Identify consensus findings.
5. Correct reviewer findings that are wrong, too vague, duplicated, or not actually blocking.
6. Decide whether the plan is already ready, needs only obvious edits, or needs Matt's input.
7. If only obvious edits are needed, produce a concrete repair brief for Codex.
8. If Matt's input is needed, do not produce a repair brief as if Codex can solve it; list the decisions/questions clearly.

Voting/consensus guardrails:

- If two or more reviewers say NOT READY, you must not publish READY unless you explicitly quote or summarize each NOT READY blocker and explain why it is wrong or non-blocking.
- If any reviewer says NOT READY, include a `Reviewer objections addressed` section that accounts for every blocking gap from that reviewer.
- Do not treat successful reviewer node execution as readiness. Only the reviewer decision and findings content can support readiness.
- If your response cannot include a real synthesis report with the sections below, route to Matt/human input rather than READY.

Return a Markdown report with:

1. Provisional decision: READY, OBVIOUS FIXES NEEDED, or NEEDS MATT
2. Reviewer decision table: Reviewer, Decision, Confidence, Blocking gaps count, Notes
3. Consensus findings: 3-6 bullets
4. Reviewer objections addressed: account for every NOT READY blocking gap, or "No reviewer returned NOT READY"
5. Corrected findings: reviewer findings you changed, downgraded, combined, or rejected
6. Blocking gaps: numbered list, each with why it blocks implementation
7. Codex repair brief: exact instructions for obvious edits only, or "None"
8. Questions for Matt: decisions that need human input, or "None"
9. Validation checklist: what to check after any Codex update

At the end of your response, include one final JSON object for workflow routing. It must be the last thing in the response.

If the plan is already READY:

{"context_updates":{"plan_ready":true,"plan_needs_fix":false,"plan_needs_human":false}}

If the plan is NOT READY but Codex should apply only obvious fixes:

{"context_updates":{"plan_ready":false,"plan_needs_fix":true,"plan_needs_human":false}}

If the plan is NOT READY because Matt needs to answer questions or make decisions:

{"context_updates":{"plan_ready":false,"plan_needs_fix":false,"plan_needs_human":true}}
