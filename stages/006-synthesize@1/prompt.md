  (53 lines omitted)
  - `homepage.feature` passes through Playwright/Cucumber against the running Phoenix app.
  - Every scenario in `member_message_deliverability.feature` passes through Playwright/Cucumber against the real routes and `POST /webhooks/postmark`.
  - Browser status-change steps wait for the projected receipt/status UI to become observable instead of assuming the webhook response means all projections are already visible.
  - `operator_email_deliverability.feature` remains excluded from the default browser run while its scenarios are tagged `@todo-web`.
  - The Elixir/domain acceptance path used by `dev check` still runs all shared scenarios, including any tagged `@todo-web`.
  - Browser acceptance failures clearly identify whether the failure is from database readiness, Phoenix startup/readiness, webhook submission, LiveView/projection timing, browser interaction, or an assertion mismatch.
  - `dev check` passes.
  
  ## Open Business Decisions
  
  None known.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Inspect the current `acceptance-tests/` Playwright/Cucumber setup and the shared feature files to identify existing step coverage and gaps.
  2. Configure the browser Cucumber default command to exclude `@todo-web`, while leaving the Elixir/domain Cucumber runner unfiltered.
  3. Build or refine the browser test lifecycle wrapper so it prepares the test database, starts Phoenix, waits for HTTP readiness, captures useful logs, and tears down reliably.
  4. Implement homepage browser steps against the real homepage route.
  5. Implement member-message browser steps by driving `/clubs`, `/clubs/:club_id`, and `/messages/:message_id` through accessible labels, roles, and stable identifiers supplied by the existing UI.
  6. Implement webhook/status browser steps by sending Postmark-style HTTP requests to `POST /webhooks/postmark`.
  7. Add bounded polling/waiting around browser-visible projections after commands and webhook posts. Prefer Playwright assertions such as `expect(...).toHaveText`, `expect.poll`, or equivalent Cucumber helper retries over fixed sleeps.
  8. Make diagnostics actionable: separate errors for Phoenix readiness, database setup, webhook HTTP failures, timeout waiting for projected UI state, and final assertion mismatches.
  9. Verify that `operator_email_deliverability.feature` is excluded only from the browser run and remains covered by the domain runner.
  10. Run `npm test` in `acceptance-tests/` and `dev check`, fixing harness/step issues until both pass.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  ### Synchronization strategy for eventually consistent projections
  
  Use harness/test-level waiting by default. After a browser action or webhook POST, the step should wait for the user-observable projection in the LiveView/UI to reach the expected state with a bounded timeout and clear failure message. The webhook HTTP response should only prove that the event was accepted; it must not be treated as proof that Commanded/Ecto projections and LiveView rendering are complete.
  
  This iteration should not make production status projections strongly consistent just to simplify tests. If implementation discovers a genuine product need for stronger consistency, that must be an intentional production design decision, documented separately, with tests explaining the user-facing guarantee. Otherwise, keep production consistency semantics unchanged and make the browser harness robust against eventual projection timing.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Developers can run the shared member-facing acceptance scenarios through a real browser and a running Phoenix app, with reliable startup/teardown, clear diagnostics, and projection-aware waiting. The browser suite can distinguish web-backed scenarios from domain-only scenarios using `@todo-web` without weakening the domain acceptance coverage.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `npm test` from `acceptance-tests/` and confirm it passes with `not @todo-web` as the default browser tag expression.
  - Confirm the browser run includes `homepage.feature` and `member_message_deliverability.feature`.
  - Confirm `operator_email_deliverability.feature` remains excluded from the browser run while tagged `@todo-web`.
  - Run the Elixir/domain acceptance path used by `dev check` and confirm it still runs all shared scenarios regardless of `@todo-web`.
  - Run `dev check` and fix any failures.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - This plan depends on the iteration 005 routes and webhook endpoint being present before automation starts; if they are not merged, implementation should stop rather than creating duplicate app surfaces in this slice.
  - LiveView and projection timing may reveal race conditions in the harness. Prefer bounded, observable waits with good diagnostics over fixed sleeps.
  - Iteration 007 should remove the operator `@todo-web` deferral and add browser automation for `/deliveries` when that operator slice is implemented.

  > None.
  > 
  > ## Non-Blocking Improvements
  > 
  > 1. **Explicit non-goals section** - While the plan excludes `@todo-web` scenarios and notes dependencies, an explicit "What we are NOT doing" section would strengthen boundaries.
  > 
  > 2. **Lifecycle wrapper naming** - Implementation step 3 says "Build or refine the browser test lifecycle wrapper" but doesn't specify where this code will live or what it will be called. However, step 1 includes inspection of existing setup, which addresses this during implementation.
  > 
  > 3. **Step implementation detail** - Steps 4-6 reference implementing browser steps but rely on implementer inspection of feature files. This is acceptable given step 1, but more specificity about which Gherkin steps need new browser implementations versus reuse could reduce exploration time.
  > 
  > 4. **UI selector strategy** - Step 5 mentions "accessible labels, roles, and stable identifiers supplied by the existing UI" but doesn't confirm these exist or specify the selector strategy (test-ids, aria-labels, etc.). The dependency on iteration 005 implies these exist, but explicit confirmation would help.
  > 
  > ## Smallest Viable Iteration
  > 
  > The current scope is already well-focused. A smaller slice might be:
  > 
  > **Just homepage.feature browser automation** - This would validate the lifecycle wrapper, Phoenix readiness checks, and basic browser step implementation without the complexity of projection timing and webhook integration.
  > 
  > However, the current scope including `member_message_deliverability.feature` is justified because:
  > - It validates the critical projection-waiting infrastructure that differentiates this from simple browser testing
  > - The homepage alone wouldn't exercise the webhook or LiveView timing challenges that are core to the iteration's value
  > - It's already minimal (excludes operator features)
  > 
  > The current scope is appropriate and should not be reduced further.
  > 
  > ## Required Plan Edits
  > 
  > None. The plan is implementable as written.
  > 
  > The implementation plan's first step explicitly includes inspection of existing code, which will surface necessary details (file locations, existing step definitions, UI selectors) before making changes. This discovery-before-modification approach is sound.
  > 
  > ## Validation Plan
  > 
  > The plan's validation section is concrete and complete:
  > 
  > ✅ **Validation is objective and testable:**
  > - Run `npm test` from `acceptance-tests/` with expected pass result
  > - Verify feature inclusion/exclusion by tag
  > - Run domain acceptance path via `dev check` 
  > - Confirm all scenarios pass regardless of `@todo-web`
  > - Run full `dev check` and fix failures
  > 
  > ✅ **Stop condition is clear:** Both `npm test` and `dev check` pass with documented feature coverage.
  > 
  > ✅ **Success proof:** The validation plan directly tests each acceptance criterion:
  > - Homepage and member message features pass browser tests
  > - Operator features excluded from browser, included in domain
  > - Diagnostic separation confirmed through test output inspection
  > - Overall quality gate passes via `dev check`
  > 
  > ## Additional Validation Recommendations
  > 
  > 1. **Projection timing validation** - Manually verify that status-change browser steps actually wait for UI updates rather than passing due to timing luck. Consider adding an intentional delay in projection to confirm waiting logic works.
  > 
  > 2. **Diagnostic clarity validation** - Intentionally trigger each failure mode (database not ready, Phoenix not started, webhook failure, projection timeout, assertion mismatch) and confirm error messages clearly identify the cause.
  > 
  > 3. **Documentation** - After implementation, update `acceptance-tests/README.md` (if it exists) or add inline comments documenting the lifecycle wrapper's startup/teardown sequence and waiting strategies for future maintainers.
  > 
  > ## Summary
  > 
  > This plan is ready for implementation. It has:
  > - Clear, testable acceptance criteria covering happy paths and error diagnostics
  > - Ordered implementation steps with sufficient detail
  > - Resolved technical decisions (projection waiting strategy)
  > - Documented dependencies (iteration 005 routes)
  > - Concrete validation approach
  > - Appropriate scope
  > 
  > The plan correctly prioritizes infrastructure quality (clear diagnostics, bounded waiting, reliable teardown) over just "making tests pass," which will pay ongoing dividends.
  > 
  > The Gemini review concurred (READY, High confidence, 0 blocking gaps), and I agree with that assessment.

You are Claude Opus acting as the repair coordinator for an iteration plan validation loop.

Use the plan text and the three model reviews in context.

The reviewer stages must have exposed both their Markdown reports and these routing context fields. The reviewers run as separate model-review stages so these fields are visible to synthesis:

- Gemini: `gemini_review_decision`, `gemini_review_confidence`, `gemini_review_blocking_gap_count`, `gemini_review_blocking_gaps`, `gemini_review_required_edits`
- Claude: `claude_review_decision`, `claude_review_confidence`, `claude_review_blocking_gap_count`, `claude_review_blocking_gaps`, `claude_review_required_edits`
- Codex/GPT: `codex_review_decision`, `codex_review_confidence`, `codex_review_blocking_gap_count`, `codex_review_blocking_gaps`, `codex_review_required_edits`

Fail closed if you cannot see all three reviewer decisions and blocking-gap summaries. Missing reviewer evidence is a workflow/tooling failure for this validation pass, not proof that the plan is ready.

Your job in this stage is to decide whether the plan is ready, needs only obvious editorial/structural correction, or needs human product/technical decisions before it can be ready.

Readiness standard:

A plan is READY only if an engineer can begin implementation without first resolving material product/business decisions or material technical design decisions, and if a reviewer can objectively validate success at the end.

A plan is NOT READY if any of these are true:

- The goal is materially ambiguous.
- The scope is too broad or lacks a smallest useful slice.
- Acceptance criteria are not concrete/testable enough.
- Important business decisions remain open.
- Implementation steps require major technical choices that are not made.
- The expected new capability or success validation is unclear.

Correction policy:

Codex may only be asked to make obvious plan edits that do not require judgment calls, such as:

- tightening wording without changing meaning
- reorganizing existing content into clearer sections
- turning already-stated expectations into objective acceptance criteria
- making implicit boundaries explicit when the plan already clearly implies them
- removing duplication or contradiction when the intended meaning is obvious

Do not ask Codex to invent product policy, scope, UX, domain, data-model, integration, or technical-design decisions. If the plan needs those decisions, fail the validation and raise them for Matt.

Synthesis instructions:

1. First verify that all three reviewer decisions and blocking-gap summaries are visible in context. If any are missing, route to Matt/human input and explain that validation evidence was incomplete.
2. Compare the three reviews.
3. Include a reviewer decision table with each reviewer's decision, confidence, blocking gap count, and notes.
4. Identify consensus findings.
5. Correct reviewer findings that are wrong, too vague, duplicated, or not actually blocking.
6. Decide whether the plan is already ready, needs only obvious edits, or needs Matt's input.
7. If only obvious edits are needed, produce a concrete repair brief for Codex.
8. If Matt's input is needed, do not produce a repair brief as if Codex can solve it; list the decisions/questions clearly.

Voting/consensus guardrails:

- If two or more reviewers say NOT READY, you must not publish READY unless you explicitly quote or summarize each NOT READY blocker and explain why it is wrong or non-blocking.
- If any reviewer says NOT READY, include a `Reviewer objections addressed` section that accounts for every blocking gap from that reviewer.
- Do not treat successful reviewer node execution as readiness. Only the reviewer decision and findings content can support readiness.
- If your response cannot include a real synthesis report with the sections below, route to Matt/human input rather than READY.

Return a Markdown report with:

1. Provisional decision: READY, OBVIOUS FIXES NEEDED, or NEEDS MATT
2. Reviewer decision table: Reviewer, Decision, Confidence, Blocking gaps count, Notes
3. Consensus findings: 3-6 bullets
4. Reviewer objections addressed: account for every NOT READY blocking gap, or "No reviewer returned NOT READY"
5. Corrected findings: reviewer findings you changed, downgraded, combined, or rejected
6. Blocking gaps: numbered list, each with why it blocks implementation
7. Codex repair brief: exact instructions for obvious edits only, or "None"
8. Questions for Matt: decisions that need human input, or "None"
9. Validation checklist: what to check after any Codex update

At the end of your response, include one final JSON object for workflow routing. It must be the last thing in the response.

If the plan is already READY:

{"context_updates":{"plan_ready":true,"plan_needs_fix":false,"plan_needs_human":false}}

If the plan is NOT READY but Codex should apply only obvious fixes:

{"context_updates":{"plan_ready":false,"plan_needs_fix":true,"plan_needs_human":false}}

If the plan is NOT READY because Matt needs to answer questions or make decisions:

{"context_updates":{"plan_ready":false,"plan_needs_fix":false,"plan_needs_human":true}}
