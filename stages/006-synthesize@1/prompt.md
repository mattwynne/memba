  ```
  (102 lines omitted)
     - `ClubsLive.Index` → `Admin.ClubsLive.Index`.
     - `ClubsLive.Show` → `Admin.ClubsLive.Show`.
     - `MessagesLive.Show` → `Admin.MessagesLive.Show`.
     - `DeliveriesLive.Index` → `Admin.DeliveriesLive.Index`.
  3. Update all internal verified routes and links:
     - Club list/detail links should use `/admin/clubs` and `/admin/clubs/:club_id`.
     - Message diagnostic links should use `/admin/messages/:message_id`.
     - Delivery overview links should use `/admin/deliveries`.
  4. Add or adjust layout functions in `MembaWeb.Layouts`:
     - Keep a Memba-branded public/app layout for marketing/legal pages.
     - Add an admin layout for staff pages, with utilitarian Memba chrome.
     - Add a club-site layout seam for future white-label pages using CSS custom properties with a neutral slate default, but do not wire fake club routing into production routes.
  5. Update the homepage links and labels so the primary operational link points to `/admin/clubs` if retained, or is presented as an internal/admin link rather than a public user journey.
  6. Update controller and LiveView tests to assert the new paths.
  7. Add route tests asserting old harness paths return 404 (not redirects).
  8. Run `bin/dev check` and fix any route/module/test failures.
  
  ## Technical Decisions
  
  - Physically move LiveView files into `web/lib/memba_web/live/admin/...` to match module names.
  - Introduce a `:staff_browser` pipeline now for future staff auth; it should currently delegate to `:browser`-equivalent plugs as an obvious auth insertion point.
  - Implement a real `Layouts.club_site` layout seam with default theme assigns (rather than a placeholder module/component).
  
  ## New Capability
  
  The application will have a clean routing and module structure that reflects the product's three surfaces. Staff tools will no longer masquerade as public pages, and future club-member work can start from a named white-label surface instead of extracting behaviour from the harness.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `bin/dev check`.
  - Automated route/controller/LiveView tests should cover:
    - public pages still work,
    - admin routes render the moved pages,
    - old harness routes return 404 (no redirects),
    - Postmark webhook route remains available.
  - Manual smoke test:
    1. Open `/` and confirm public homepage renders.
    2. Open `/admin/clubs`, create a club, and open its detail page.
    3. Add or view members on `/admin/clubs/:club_id`.
    4. Send or inspect a message if test data is available.
    5. Open `/admin/messages/:message_id` and confirm diagnostics are staff-facing.
    6. Open `/admin/deliveries` and confirm the operator overview renders.
    7. Confirm `/clubs` returns the normal 404 page (and does not render the club list).
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - This does not provide real security for `/admin/*`; staff auth must be a later slice before real users or sensitive data are present.
  - The member-facing white-label routes are intentionally not exposed yet. The next member-facing slice should start with real club resolution and/or magic-link auth rather than temporary URL hacks.
  - Moving modules can break tests that refer to route paths, DOM IDs, or module names; keep DOM IDs stable where acceptance tests depend on them.
  - The existing `ClubsLive.Show` still mixes add-member, send-message, and message list responsibilities. Further extraction should happen when member-facing noticeboard/compose pages are implemented.

  > # Independent Plan Review: Iteration 009
  > 
  > ## Decision: READY
  > 
  > ## Confidence: High
  > 
  > ## Blocking Gaps
  > None identified.
  > 
  > ## Non-Blocking Improvements
  > 
  > 1. **Make goal and outcome more prominent**: The "New Capability" section clearly states the outcome, but the plan would benefit from a prominent goal statement at the top explaining why this routing reorganization delivers value (e.g., "Establish clear architectural boundaries between public, staff, and future club-member surfaces").
  > 
  > 2. **Formalize acceptance criteria**: The validation plan provides concrete testable steps, but reformatting them as explicit acceptance criteria (e.g., "After this iteration, `/admin/clubs` renders the club list and `/clubs` returns 404") would improve clarity.
  > 
  > 3. **Clarify layout creation vs. modification**: The plan says "Add or adjust layout functions" but the Technical Decisions section specifies "Implement a real `Layouts.club_site` layout seam". Make explicit which layouts already exist and which are new.
  > 
  > 4. **Specify test update scope**: "Update controller and LiveView tests to assert the new paths" could list the specific test files that need path updates (e.g., `ClubsLiveTest`, `MessagesLiveTest`).
  > 
  > 5. **Make non-goals explicit upfront**: The Risks/Follow-ups section clarifies what's NOT being done (real auth, white-label routes), but stating these as explicit non-goals earlier would help scope clarity.
  > 
  > ## Smallest Viable Iteration
  > 
  > The current scope is already close to minimal for a coherent outcome. The routing reorganization is interconnected—you cannot move routes piecemeal without creating inconsistent intermediate states.
  > 
  > **Potential reduction**: The club-site layout work could be deferred since it's explicitly "for future white-label pages" and "not wired into production routes." Moving only the public and admin surfaces would be smaller, but the current scope is reasonable as a single architectural shift.
  > 
  > Current iteration size is appropriate.
  > 
  > ## Required Plan Edits
  > 
  > None. The plan is implementable as written.
  > 
  > **Optional improvements** (non-blocking):
  > - Add explicit goal statement before Implementation Tasks
  > - Reformat validation steps as acceptance criteria
  > - Clarify which layouts are new vs. modified
  > - List specific test files requiring path updates
  > 
  > ## Validation Plan Assessment
  > 
  > The validation plan is strong:
  > 
  > **Automated validation:**
  > - `bin/dev check` passes
  > - Route tests verify public pages work
  > - Route tests verify admin routes render
  > - Route tests verify old harness routes return 404
  > - Route tests verify Postmark webhook remains available
  > 
  > **Manual smoke test:**
  > - 7 specific steps covering public homepage, club CRUD, member management, message diagnostics, and delivery overview
  > - Explicit verification that old harness routes return 404
  > 
  > **Stop condition:** Clear—smoke test passes and check passes.
  > 
  > **Gaps:** None. The validation covers happy paths, error states (404s), and critical integration points (webhook). Edge cases like URL collision are implicit in the 404 tests.
  > 
  > ## Overall Assessment
  > 
  > This is a well-structured refactoring plan with clear technical decisions, specific implementation steps, and concrete validation. The scope is coherent and focused on establishing clean architectural boundaries. While format improvements could enhance clarity, the plan is complete enough for implementation.
  > 
  > The iteration will deliver clear value: staff tools will have proper routing that signals their purpose, and future club-member work has a named architectural surface to build upon rather than extracting behavior from development harness routes.
  > 
  > **Recommendation:** Proceed to implementation.

You are Claude Opus acting as the repair coordinator for an iteration plan validation loop.

Use the plan text and the three model reviews in context.

The reviewer stages must have exposed both their Markdown reports and these routing context fields. The reviewers run as separate model-review stages so these fields are visible to synthesis:

- Gemini: `gemini_review_decision`, `gemini_review_confidence`, `gemini_review_blocking_gap_count`, `gemini_review_blocking_gaps`, `gemini_review_required_edits`
- Claude: `claude_review_decision`, `claude_review_confidence`, `claude_review_blocking_gap_count`, `claude_review_blocking_gaps`, `claude_review_required_edits`
- Codex/GPT: `codex_review_decision`, `codex_review_confidence`, `codex_review_blocking_gap_count`, `codex_review_blocking_gaps`, `codex_review_required_edits`

Fail closed if you cannot see all three reviewer decisions and blocking-gap summaries. Missing reviewer evidence is a workflow/tooling failure for this validation pass, not proof that the plan is ready.

Your job in this stage is to decide whether the plan is ready, needs only obvious editorial/structural correction, or needs human product/technical decisions before it can be ready.

Readiness standard:

A plan is READY only if an engineer can begin implementation without first resolving material product/business decisions or material technical design decisions, and if a reviewer can objectively validate success at the end.

A plan is NOT READY if any of these are true:

- The goal is materially ambiguous.
- The scope is too broad or lacks a smallest useful slice.
- Acceptance criteria are not concrete/testable enough.
- Important business decisions remain open.
- Implementation steps require major technical choices that are not made.
- The expected new capability or success validation is unclear.
- The plan expects shared acceptance `.feature` file edits but lacks a `## Allowed acceptance feature changes` section naming each exact file, the allowed kind of change, the reason, and how coverage is preserved or intentionally changed.

Correction policy:

Codex may only be asked to make obvious plan edits that do not require judgment calls, such as:

- tightening wording without changing meaning
- reorganizing existing content into clearer sections
- turning already-stated expectations into objective acceptance criteria
- making implicit boundaries explicit when the plan already clearly implies them
- removing duplication or contradiction when the intended meaning is obvious

Do not ask Codex to invent product policy, scope, UX, domain, data-model, integration, or technical-design decisions. If the plan needs those decisions, fail the validation and raise them for Matt.

Synthesis instructions:

1. First verify that all three reviewer decisions and blocking-gap summaries are visible in context. If any are missing, route to Matt/human input and explain that validation evidence was incomplete.
2. Compare the three reviews.
3. Include a reviewer decision table with each reviewer's decision, confidence, blocking gap count, and notes.
4. Identify consensus findings.
5. Correct reviewer findings that are wrong, too vague, duplicated, or not actually blocking.
6. Decide whether the plan is already ready, needs only obvious edits, or needs Matt's input.
7. If only obvious edits are needed, produce a concrete repair brief for Codex.
8. If Matt's input is needed, do not produce a repair brief as if Codex can solve it; list the decisions/questions clearly.

Voting/consensus guardrails:

- If two or more reviewers say NOT READY, you must not publish READY unless you explicitly quote or summarize each NOT READY blocker and explain why it is wrong or non-blocking.
- If any reviewer says NOT READY, include a `Reviewer objections addressed` section that accounts for every blocking gap from that reviewer.
- Do not treat successful reviewer node execution as readiness. Only the reviewer decision and findings content can support readiness.
- If your response cannot include a real synthesis report with the sections below, route to Matt/human input rather than READY.

Return a Markdown report with:

1. Provisional decision: READY, OBVIOUS FIXES NEEDED, or NEEDS MATT
2. Reviewer decision table: Reviewer, Decision, Confidence, Blocking gaps count, Notes
3. Consensus findings: 3-6 bullets
4. Reviewer objections addressed: account for every NOT READY blocking gap, or "No reviewer returned NOT READY"
5. Corrected findings: reviewer findings you changed, downgraded, combined, or rejected
6. Blocking gaps: numbered list, each with why it blocks implementation
7. Codex repair brief: exact instructions for obvious edits only, or "None"
8. Questions for Matt: decisions that need human input, or "None"
9. Validation checklist: what to check after any Codex update

At the end of your response, include one final JSON object for workflow routing. It must be the last thing in the response.

If the plan is already READY:

{"context_updates":{"plan_ready":true,"plan_needs_fix":false,"plan_needs_human":false}}

If the plan is NOT READY but Codex should apply only obvious fixes:

{"context_updates":{"plan_ready":false,"plan_needs_fix":true,"plan_needs_human":false}}

If the plan is NOT READY because Matt needs to answer questions or make decisions:

{"context_updates":{"plan_ready":false,"plan_needs_fix":false,"plan_needs_human":true}}
