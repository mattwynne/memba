- Output:
  ```
  (138 lines omitted)
     - all visible groups collapsed initially;
     - `handle_event("toggle_receipt_group", ...)` toggles a status key;
     - avoid custom JavaScript unless needed.
  8. Preserve the existing stable DOM/test attributes for recipient rows.
  9. Update browser acceptance support, if needed, so existing member-message scenarios can find addressed recipient rows by expanding the relevant visible group before asserting row content. Do not change the Gherkin feature text for this iteration.
  10. Add focused LiveView/ConnCase tests covering:
     - route and authorization behaviours preserved;
     - summary counts and percentages for mixed statuses;
     - all visible groups collapsed by default;
     - expand/collapse reveals and hides rows;
     - zero-count statuses appear in the summary only, not as empty expandable groups;
     - no operator-only fields appear on the member page.
  11. Run the existing member-message browser Cucumber scenarios and `dev check`.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  - Exact LiveView module name and whether small helper functions live in the LiveView or a presentation module. Prefer simple module boundaries that keep receipt calculations testable without over-engineering.
  
  Resolved for this plan:
  
  - Zero-count statuses appear in the “Who got this” summary only, with count `0` and `0%`. They do not appear as empty collapsible group headers in the recipient list.
  - Existing Gherkin scenarios remain unchanged. Browser acceptance support may expand the relevant visible receipt group before asserting addressed recipient rows, while LiveView tests cover the collapse/expand UI behaviour directly.
  - Percentages are displayed as whole numbers by rounding each status independently from addressed-recipient totals; displayed status percentages are not force-adjusted to sum to exactly 100.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Members can scan a message's reach using a summary bar with counts and percentages, then expand specific receipt groups to see which members are in each status without leaving the page.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `dev check`.
  - Run targeted LiveView/Phoenix tests for the new member message detail LiveView.
  - Confirm existing `acceptance-tests/features/member_message_deliverability.feature` passes unchanged through the browser runner; if row assertions fail because groups are collapsed, fix the browser support to expand the relevant group rather than changing the feature language.
  - Manual demo:
    - sign in as Alice;
    - open a message with mixed receipt statuses;
    - confirm the summary bar shows all four statuses, including any zero-count statuses;
    - confirm zero-count statuses do not appear as empty groups in the recipient list;
    - confirm non-empty group counts, percentages, descriptions, and default collapsed state;
    - expand and collapse each non-empty group;
    - confirm recipient rows appear only when their group is expanded;
    - confirm no operator-only details are visible;
    - confirm `/admin/*` diagnostics still show operator detail for staff.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - LiveView conversion may require carefully preserving controller-era auth and error semantics.
  - Browser acceptance support may need a small update to expand the relevant group before asserting recipient rows; keep this in support code and leave the feature language unchanged.
  - Percent rounding can produce totals that do not add exactly to 100%; this plan uses deterministic independent status rounding and accepts non-100 displayed totals.
  - This does not address dashboard polish or separate compose screens; those remain good future iterations.

  > # Iteration Plan Review: Member Receipt Detail LiveView Polish
  > 
  > ## Decision: READY
  > 
  > ## Confidence: Medium
  > 
  > ## Blocking Gaps
  > 
  > None. The plan is implementable as written with clear scope, implementation steps, and validation approach.
  > 
  > ## Non-Blocking Improvements
  > 
  > 1. **Add explicit "## Acceptance Criteria" section** - While success conditions exist (scattered in step 10 and the validation plan), they should be formalized in a dedicated section before implementation steps. This would make validation criteria immediately visible and easier to verify against. The current test descriptions ("route and authorization behaviours preserved; summary counts and percentages for mixed statuses; all visible groups collapsed by default; etc.") should be elevated to formal acceptance criteria.
  > 
  > 2. **Consider explicit "## Acceptance Scenarios / Feature Files" section** - The Gherkin strategy is documented across multiple locations (step 9, resolved decisions, validation plan) but could be clearer in a dedicated section. The rationale for not adding new scenarios is present but distributed.
  > 
  > 3. **Reconsider new Gherkin scenarios for new behaviors** - The plan explicitly decides not to add new Gherkin scenarios, relying on existing `member_message_deliverability.feature` coverage plus LiveView tests. While this decision is documented and rational for a "polish" iteration, the summary bar display and expand/collapse interactions are genuinely new user-facing behaviors that might benefit from stakeholder-readable examples. The current approach treats this as purely a presentation change, which is defensible but worth reconsidering.
  > 
  > 4. **Clarify "member-message scenarios" reference** - Step 9 mentions "existing member-message browser Cucumber scenarios" - confirm this refers to the `member_message_deliverability.feature` file mentioned later, or list all relevant files.
  > 
  > ## Smallest Viable Iteration
  > 
  > The current scope is already appropriately focused. A smaller slice could separate:
  > - **Phase 1**: LiveView conversion only (preserve existing UI exactly)
  > - **Phase 2**: Add grouping and summary bar
  > 
  > However, since LiveView naturally enables the collapse/expand behavior and the current scope is cohesive around "polish the member receipt view," the existing iteration boundary is sound.
  > 
  > ## Required Plan Edits
  > 
  > None. The plan is implementable and thorough, with all critical decisions resolved. The improvements above would enhance clarity and documentation quality but are not required for successful implementation.
  > 
  > ## Validation Plan Assessment
  > 
  > The validation approach is comprehensive:
  > - Automated: `dev check`, targeted LiveView tests, existing Cucumber scenarios
  > - Manual: Structured demo covering all behaviors
  > - Clear success criteria: tests pass, manual checks confirm expected behaviors
  > - Explicit coverage: permissions, edge cases (zero-count statuses), data presentation, authorization
  > 
  > The stop condition is clear: all automated checks pass, manual demo confirms expected user experience, no operator-only details leak to member view.
  > 
  > ## Strengths
  > 
  > 1. **Scope discipline**: Clear boundaries (no dashboard/compose changes, preserve admin diagnostics)
  > 2. **Decision documentation**: All resolved decisions are explicit (zero-count handling, percentage rounding, Gherkin strategy)
  > 3. **Implementation specificity**: Steps name modules, routes, data structures, testing points
  > 4. **Risk awareness**: Identifies auth preservation, browser support updates, percent rounding as risks
  > 
  > ## Summary
  > 
  > This plan is ready for implementation. The core content is thorough and decisions are resolved. The medium confidence reflects organizational improvements that would enhance readability but don't block execution. The iteration will succeed or fail based on implementation quality, not plan completeness.

You are Claude Opus acting as the repair coordinator for an iteration plan validation loop.

Use the plan text and the three model reviews in context.

The reviewer stages must have exposed both their Markdown reports and these routing context fields. The reviewers run as separate model-review stages so these fields are visible to synthesis:

- Gemini: `gemini_review_decision`, `gemini_review_confidence`, `gemini_review_blocking_gap_count`, `gemini_review_blocking_gaps`, `gemini_review_required_edits`
- Claude: `claude_review_decision`, `claude_review_confidence`, `claude_review_blocking_gap_count`, `claude_review_blocking_gaps`, `claude_review_required_edits`
- Codex/GPT: `codex_review_decision`, `codex_review_confidence`, `codex_review_blocking_gap_count`, `codex_review_blocking_gaps`, `codex_review_required_edits`

Fail closed if you cannot see all three reviewer decisions and blocking-gap summaries. Missing reviewer evidence is a workflow/tooling failure for this validation pass, not proof that the plan is ready.

Your job in this stage is to decide whether the plan is ready, needs only obvious editorial/structural correction, or needs human product/technical decisions before it can be ready.

Readiness standard:

A plan is READY only if an engineer can begin implementation without first resolving material product/business decisions or material technical design decisions, and if a reviewer can objectively validate success at the end.

A plan is NOT READY if any of these are true:

- The goal is materially ambiguous.
- The scope is too broad or lacks a smallest useful slice.
- Acceptance criteria are not concrete/testable enough.
- The plan does not classify the iteration as behaviour-facing or technical/engineering.
- A behaviour-facing or domain-policy plan lacks an `## Acceptance Scenarios / Feature Files` section with either named shared Cucumber feature file(s)/scenarios or an explicit rationale for why Gherkin would not add useful stakeholder-readable examples.
- Important business decisions remain open.
- Implementation steps require major technical choices that are not made.
- The expected new capability or success validation is unclear.
- The plan expects shared acceptance `.feature` file edits but lacks a `## Allowed acceptance feature changes` section naming each exact file, the allowed kind of change, the reason, and how coverage is preserved or intentionally changed.

Correction policy:

Codex may only be asked to make obvious plan edits that do not require judgment calls, such as:

- tightening wording without changing meaning
- reorganizing existing content into clearer sections
- turning already-stated expectations into objective acceptance criteria
- making implicit boundaries explicit when the plan already clearly implies them
- removing duplication or contradiction when the intended meaning is obvious

Do not ask Codex to invent product policy, scope, UX, domain, data-model, integration, or technical-design decisions. If the plan needs those decisions, fail the validation and raise them for Matt.

Synthesis instructions:

1. First verify that all three reviewer decisions and blocking-gap summaries are visible in context. If any are missing, route to Matt/human input and explain that validation evidence was incomplete.
2. Compare the three reviews.
3. Include a reviewer decision table with each reviewer's decision, confidence, blocking gap count, and notes.
4. Identify consensus findings.
5. Correct reviewer findings that are wrong, too vague, duplicated, or not actually blocking.
6. Decide whether the plan is already ready, needs only obvious edits, or needs Matt's input.
7. If only obvious edits are needed, produce a concrete repair brief for Codex.
8. If Matt's input is needed, do not produce a repair brief as if Codex can solve it; list the decisions/questions clearly.

Voting/consensus guardrails:

- If two or more reviewers say NOT READY, you must not publish READY unless you explicitly quote or summarize each NOT READY blocker and explain why it is wrong or non-blocking.
- If any reviewer says NOT READY, include a `Reviewer objections addressed` section that accounts for every blocking gap from that reviewer.
- Do not treat successful reviewer node execution as readiness. Only the reviewer decision and findings content can support readiness.
- If your response cannot include a real synthesis report with the sections below, route to Matt/human input rather than READY.

Return a Markdown report with:

1. Provisional decision: READY, OBVIOUS FIXES NEEDED, or NEEDS MATT
2. Reviewer decision table: Reviewer, Decision, Confidence, Blocking gaps count, Notes
3. Consensus findings: 3-6 bullets
4. Reviewer objections addressed: account for every NOT READY blocking gap, or "No reviewer returned NOT READY"
5. Corrected findings: reviewer findings you changed, downgraded, combined, or rejected
6. Blocking gaps: numbered list, each with why it blocks implementation
7. Codex repair brief: exact instructions for obvious edits only, or "None"
8. Questions for Matt: decisions that need human input, or "None"
9. Validation checklist: what to check after any Codex update

At the end of your response, include one final JSON object for workflow routing. It must be the last thing in the response.

If the plan is already READY:

{"context_updates":{"plan_ready":true,"plan_needs_fix":false,"plan_needs_human":false}}

If the plan is NOT READY but Codex should apply only obvious fixes:

{"context_updates":{"plan_ready":false,"plan_needs_fix":true,"plan_needs_human":false}}

If the plan is NOT READY because Matt needs to answer questions or make decisions:

{"context_updates":{"plan_ready":false,"plan_needs_fix":false,"plan_needs_human":true}}
