      - default slug generation from names;
      - valid and invalid staff-entered slugs;
      - duplicate slug live feedback and server rejection;
      - database unique constraint;
      - projection contains slug;
      - lookup by slug;
      - public host routing and unknown-host 404;
      - existing club-id queries and member routes still work;
      - admin UI displays and edits slug.
  15. Run `dev check`.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  None known.
  
  Decisions made during planning:
  
  - Maximum slug length is 32 characters.
  - Public club subdomains use `slug.clubs.memba.io`, not `slug.memba.io`.
  - Actual production DNS setup is a prerequisite outside Fabro, not part of implementation delivery.
  - Staff-entered slugs must already be address-safe; the app should not silently kebab-case arbitrary staff input.
  - Duplicate slug feedback should be live in the client and enforced on the server/database.
  - Old slug-less `ClubCreated` event replay does not need compatibility support because there is no live production data yet.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Memba can identify a club by a stable public slug, staff can manage that slug safely, and public visitors can reach a club's public page at a human-readable subdomain such as `kmc.clubs.memba.io`.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `dev check`.
  - Run targeted Membership domain/projection tests for club creation, slug generation, slug validation, uniqueness, and slug lookup.
  - Run targeted migration/persistence tests verifying `membership_clubs.slug` is non-null and unique.
  - Run targeted Phoenix/LiveView tests verifying staff can see/edit slugs and receive live duplicate/invalid feedback.
  - Run targeted routing/controller/LiveView tests verifying:
    - `kmc.clubs.memba.io` renders Kootenay Mountaineering Club's public page;
    - `unknown.clubs.memba.io` returns 404;
    - existing `club_id` public/member links still work.
  - Confirm the new Cucumber feature file remains tagged `@wip` until implemented.
  - Manual production validation after deploy:
    - confirm wildcard DNS for `*.clubs.memba.io` resolves to the production app;
    - confirm `https://kmc.clubs.memba.io` shows KMC's public page;
    - confirm `https://unknown.clubs.memba.io` returns 404.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Host-based routing may interact with endpoint URL, allowed-host, proxy, or deployment configuration. Tests should cover host handling explicitly.
  - Slug rename/aliasing will matter once public subdomains or inbound email addresses are advertised, but it is intentionally out of scope here.
  - Future inbound email and hosted subdomains may require reserved slugs such as `www`, `app`, `admin`, `support`, `postmaster`, `abuse`, or `no-reply`; that reserved-word policy can be added before wider public use.
  - Production DNS propagation and TLS certificate coverage for `*.clubs.memba.io` must be verified outside Fabro.

Synthesize the independent implementation reviews for docs/iterations/015-club-slugs/plan.md.

This review runs after implementation has already merged to `main`. It is a smell radar and bounded polish loop, not a delivery gate. Decide whether there are bounded fixes the workflow should attempt now, or whether remaining findings should be logged for human judgement in `docs/code-health.md` while the run continues.

## Context

Use the prior context from this workflow run:

- The iteration plan text and its explicit requirements.
- Implementation evidence collected from `fd718797a792afa127e15fc8d58ee59ee3c07a8c` to `HEAD`.
- Successful `dev check` output.
- Independent review reports (Claude, Codex, Gemini).
- Previous synthesis decisions and repair summaries, if this is a repeated synthesis after repair.

## Standards

- Treat automated tests and implementation plan-conformance as already-owned by the implementation workflow.
- Request automatic fixes only for concrete, bounded refactoring, maintainability, project-convention, documentation, or low-risk test-quality issues that can be resolved without changing product behaviour or feature files.
- Do not request edits to acceptance feature files (`*.feature`).
- Do not introduce new product behaviour in review.
- If a finding requires product, architecture, scope, or acceptance-criteria judgement, do not block. Mark it as a code-health/manual follow-up.
- If a prior automatic repair attempted the same issue and it still remains, do not request another repair. Mark it as a code-health/manual follow-up.
- If no bounded automatic fixes are worth attempting, accept the review and let the next step record any judgement-worthy findings in `docs/code-health.md`.

## Output format

Return a concise Markdown synthesis with these sections:

### Decision

One of: **ACCEPTED** or **FIX**.

### Review synthesis

Summarize the important findings across reviewers.

### Bounded automatic fixes

If **FIX**, list exact bounded changes to make, with constraints and validation.

### Code-health findings for human judgement

List findings that should be logged to `docs/code-health.md` because they are not safe bounded review fixes. If none, state "None."

### Fixed or dismissed findings

Note findings that were already fixed during this review run, duplicates, or findings you are dismissing as not supported by evidence.

## Routing JSON

End your response with exactly one JSON object that Fabro can use for routing. The JSON object must be the final text in the response and must not be wrapped in a Markdown code fence.

Use one of these shapes:

- Accepted / log-only findings:
  `{"context_updates":{"implementation_accepted":true,"review_fixes_available":false}}`
- Automatic fixes appropriate:
  `{"context_updates":{"implementation_accepted":false,"review_fixes_available":true,"review_blockers":[{"id":"fix-id-1","title":"Short fix title","source":"review_synthesis","first_seen_stage":"synthesize_review","status":"open"}]}}`

Do not route to human input from this post-merge review. Human-judgement findings belong in the Markdown section above so the next step can record them in `docs/code-health.md`.
