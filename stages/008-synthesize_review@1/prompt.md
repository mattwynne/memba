Goal: Review a completed plan-conforming iteration implementation for code polish, ADR conformance, and code-health signals

     - all visible groups collapsed initially;
     - `handle_event("toggle_receipt_group", ...)` toggles a status key;
     - avoid custom JavaScript unless needed.
  8. Preserve the existing stable DOM/test attributes for recipient rows.
  9. Update browser acceptance support, if needed, so existing member-message scenarios can find addressed recipient rows by expanding the relevant visible group before asserting row content. Do not change the Gherkin feature text for this iteration.
  10. Add focused LiveView/ConnCase tests covering:
     - route and authorization behaviours preserved;
     - summary counts and percentages for mixed statuses;
     - all visible groups collapsed by default;
     - expand/collapse reveals and hides rows;
     - zero-count statuses appear in the summary only, not as empty expandable groups;
     - no operator-only fields appear on the member page.
  11. Run the existing member-message browser Cucumber scenarios and `dev check`.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  - Exact LiveView module name and whether small helper functions live in the LiveView or a presentation module. Prefer simple module boundaries that keep receipt calculations testable without over-engineering.
  
  Resolved for this plan:
  
  - Zero-count statuses appear in the “Who got this” summary only, with count `0` and `0%`. They do not appear as empty collapsible group headers in the recipient list.
  - Existing Gherkin scenarios remain unchanged. Browser acceptance support may expand the relevant visible receipt group before asserting addressed recipient rows, while LiveView tests cover the collapse/expand UI behaviour directly.
  - Percentages are displayed as whole numbers by rounding each status independently from addressed-recipient totals; displayed status percentages are not force-adjusted to sum to exactly 100.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Members can scan a message's reach using a summary bar with counts and percentages, then expand specific receipt groups to see which members are in each status without leaving the page.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `dev check`.
  - Run targeted LiveView/Phoenix tests for the new member message detail LiveView.
  - Confirm existing `acceptance-tests/features/member_message_deliverability.feature` passes unchanged through the browser runner; if row assertions fail because groups are collapsed, fix the browser support to expand the relevant group rather than changing the feature language.
  - Manual demo:
    - sign in as Alice;
    - open a message with mixed receipt statuses;
    - confirm the summary bar shows all four statuses, including any zero-count statuses;
    - confirm zero-count statuses do not appear as empty groups in the recipient list;
    - confirm non-empty group counts, percentages, descriptions, and default collapsed state;
    - expand and collapse each non-empty group;
    - confirm recipient rows appear only when their group is expanded;
    - confirm no operator-only details are visible;
    - confirm `/admin/*` diagnostics still show operator detail for staff.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - LiveView conversion may require carefully preserving controller-era auth and error semantics.
  - Browser acceptance support may need a small update to expand the relevant group before asserting recipient rows; keep this in support code and leave the feature language unchanged.
  - Percent rounding can produce totals that do not add exactly to 100%; this plan uses deterministic independent status rounding and accepts non-100 displayed totals.
  - This does not address dashboard polish or separate compose screens; those remain good future iterations.

Synthesize the independent implementation reviews for docs/iterations/012-member-receipt-detail-liveview-polish/plan.md.

This review runs after implementation has already merged to `main`. It is a smell radar and bounded polish loop, not a delivery gate. Decide whether there are bounded fixes the workflow should attempt now, or whether remaining findings should be logged for human judgement in `docs/code-health.md` while the run continues.

## Context

Use the prior context from this workflow run:

- The iteration plan text and its explicit requirements.
- Implementation evidence collected from `5d0a18418cf5735ed22d6037f504946a649be174` to `HEAD`.
- Successful `dev check` output.
- Independent review reports (Claude, Codex, Gemini).
- Previous synthesis decisions and repair summaries, if this is a repeated synthesis after repair.

## Standards

- Treat automated tests and implementation plan-conformance as already-owned by the implementation workflow.
- Request automatic fixes only for concrete, bounded refactoring, maintainability, project-convention, documentation, or low-risk test-quality issues that can be resolved without changing product behaviour or feature files.
- Do not request edits to acceptance feature files (`*.feature`).
- Do not introduce new product behaviour in review.
- If a finding requires product, architecture, scope, or acceptance-criteria judgement, do not block. Mark it as a code-health/manual follow-up.
- If a prior automatic repair attempted the same issue and it still remains, do not request another repair. Mark it as a code-health/manual follow-up.
- If no bounded automatic fixes are worth attempting, accept the review and let the next step record any judgement-worthy findings in `docs/code-health.md`.

## Output format

Return a concise Markdown synthesis with these sections:

### Decision

One of: **ACCEPTED** or **FIX**.

### Review synthesis

Summarize the important findings across reviewers.

### Bounded automatic fixes

If **FIX**, list exact bounded changes to make, with constraints and validation.

### Code-health findings for human judgement

List findings that should be logged to `docs/code-health.md` because they are not safe bounded review fixes. If none, state "None."

### Fixed or dismissed findings

Note findings that were already fixed during this review run, duplicates, or findings you are dismissing as not supported by evidence.

## Routing JSON

End your response with exactly one JSON object that Fabro can use for routing. The JSON object must be the final text in the response and must not be wrapped in a Markdown code fence.

Use one of these shapes:

- Accepted / log-only findings:
  `{"context_updates":{"implementation_accepted":true,"review_fixes_available":false}}`
- Automatic fixes appropriate:
  `{"context_updates":{"implementation_accepted":false,"review_fixes_available":true,"review_blockers":[{"id":"fix-id-1","title":"Short fix title","source":"review_synthesis","first_seen_stage":"synthesize_review","status":"open"}]}}`

Do not route to human input from this post-merge review. Human-judgement findings belong in the Markdown section above so the next step can record them in `docs/code-health.md`.
