Goal: Review a completed plan-conforming iteration implementation for code polish, ADR conformance, and code-health signals

  9. Ensure the club home has no inline compose form; remove any remaining inline compose markup/handlers so compose is only reached through the CTA link to `/messages/new?club_id=<club_id>`.
  10. Add focused LiveView/Phoenix tests for:
     - signed-in active member sees dashboard;
     - signed-in non-member/inactive member receives forbidden;
     - logged-out/public club page behaviour is preserved;
     - CTA points at compose route;
     - no inline compose form;
     - message rows and links render;
     - receipt glance renders with member-facing vocabulary;
     - timestamp labels use `inserted_at` when available and are omitted when unavailable;
     - empty states render;
     - active-member card renders count/avatar stack;
     - no operator-only fields leak.
  11. Run existing browser Cucumber for member-message deliverability and `dev check`.
  
  ## Technical Decisions
  
  - Route organization: keep `GET /?club_id=<club_id>` as the user-visible address. Preserve the controller/public path for logged-out visitors and use it as the dispatcher/public rendering boundary; signed-in active members with a selected club see `MembaWeb.MemberDashboardLive` for the same URL. No separate dashboard URL is introduced in this slice.
  - Receipt glances: calculate row view data in a dedicated presentation/query helper, `MembaWeb.MemberDashboardPresentation`, using existing receipt projections and `MembaWeb.MemberReceiptPresentation` vocabulary.
  - Message row “when” metadata: use `Memba.Messaging.Projections.Message.inserted_at` as the sent/recorded timestamp. If a row has no timestamp, omit the timestamp label for that row instead of inventing data or showing “Unknown”.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Members land on a polished, LiveView-backed club dashboard that matches the remaining wireframe direction and gives quick access to compose, recent messages, and active-member context.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `dev check`.
  - Run targeted LiveView/Phoenix tests for the member dashboard.
  - Run `acceptance-tests/features/member_message_deliverability.feature` through the browser runner.
  - Manual demo:
    - sign in as Alice;
    - open Kootenay Mountaineering Club;
    - confirm the dashboard is visually aligned with `dashboard.jsx`;
    - confirm “Send club message” opens `/messages/new?club_id=<club_id>`;
    - confirm recent message rows link to message details and show receipt glances where available;
    - confirm active-member card and avatar stack;
    - confirm empty states in a brand-new club;
    - confirm no operator-only delivery details appear.
  
  ## Stop Condition
  
  Iteration 014 is complete when all acceptance criteria pass, `dev check` is green, the targeted dashboard tests and existing member-message browser scenario pass, and there are no regressions in logged-out/public or forbidden member flows for `GET /?club_id=<club_id>`.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Routing `/?club_id=` between public marketing and member LiveView needs care to preserve iteration 010 auth behaviour.
  - Receipt-glance data may require efficient projection queries to avoid N+1 reads if many messages are shown.
  - Current message projections may not have sent timestamps; avoid blocking the iteration on unavailable metadata.
  - This finishes the current member messaging wireframe set; future design work should be planned as new product slices rather than more cleanup.

Synthesize the independent implementation reviews for docs/iterations/014-member-dashboard-liveview-polish/plan.md.

This review runs after implementation has already merged to `main`. It is a smell radar and bounded polish loop, not a delivery gate. Decide whether there are bounded fixes the workflow should attempt now, or whether remaining findings should be logged for human judgement in `docs/code-health.md` while the run continues.

## Context

Use the prior context from this workflow run:

- The iteration plan text and its explicit requirements.
- Implementation evidence collected from `813cd32b011995b9f563ac2f789fca094dffe50a` to `HEAD`.
- Successful `dev check` output.
- Independent review reports (Claude, Codex, Gemini).
- Previous synthesis decisions and repair summaries, if this is a repeated synthesis after repair.

## Standards

- Treat automated tests and implementation plan-conformance as already-owned by the implementation workflow.
- Request automatic fixes only for concrete, bounded refactoring, maintainability, project-convention, documentation, or low-risk test-quality issues that can be resolved without changing product behaviour or feature files.
- Do not request edits to acceptance feature files (`*.feature`).
- Do not introduce new product behaviour in review.
- If a finding requires product, architecture, scope, or acceptance-criteria judgement, do not block. Mark it as a code-health/manual follow-up.
- If a prior automatic repair attempted the same issue and it still remains, do not request another repair. Mark it as a code-health/manual follow-up.
- If no bounded automatic fixes are worth attempting, accept the review and let the next step record any judgement-worthy findings in `docs/code-health.md`.

## Output format

Return a concise Markdown synthesis with these sections:

### Decision

One of: **ACCEPTED** or **FIX**.

### Review synthesis

Summarize the important findings across reviewers.

### Bounded automatic fixes

If **FIX**, list exact bounded changes to make, with constraints and validation.

### Code-health findings for human judgement

List findings that should be logged to `docs/code-health.md` because they are not safe bounded review fixes. If none, state "None."

### Fixed or dismissed findings

Note findings that were already fixed during this review run, duplicates, or findings you are dismissing as not supported by evidence.

## Routing JSON

End your response with exactly one JSON object that Fabro can use for routing. The JSON object must be the final text in the response and must not be wrapped in a Markdown code fence.

Use one of these shapes:

- Accepted / log-only findings:
  `{"context_updates":{"implementation_accepted":true,"review_fixes_available":false}}`
- Automatic fixes appropriate:
  `{"context_updates":{"implementation_accepted":false,"review_fixes_available":true,"review_blockers":[{"id":"fix-id-1","title":"Short fix title","source":"review_synthesis","first_seen_stage":"synthesize_review","status":"open"}]}}`

Do not route to human input from this post-merge review. Human-judgement findings belong in the Markdown section above so the next step can record them in `docs/code-health.md`.
