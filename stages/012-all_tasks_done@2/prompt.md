    `list_active_members_of_club/1` returning enough identity to drive recipient
    resolution (id, name, email).
  - Cucumber step definitions for all Background lines in
    `member_message_deliverability.feature` and
    `operator_email_deliverability.feature`:
    - "<Club> is a club"
    - "<People> are people" / "<Person> is a person"
    - "<People> are members of <Club>" / "<Person> is a member of <Club>"
  - ExUnit coverage for Person and Membership aggregate rules and projector
    behaviour.
  
  ### Out of scope
  
  - Anything Messaging.
  - Lapsed/revoked membership.
  - Household or family modelling.
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  
  - `Memba.Membership.list_active_members_of_club/1` returns the active
    members of the given club and excludes members of other clubs.
  - A person created independently can be added as a member of a club via
    domain commands.
  - Background steps for both shared feature files pass under Elixir Cucumber.
  - ExUnit covers aggregate decisions and projector behaviour.
  - `devenv shell mix precommit` passes.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Add `Person` aggregate, `CreatePerson` command, `PersonCreated` event,
     and Person projector + query.
  2. Add `Membership` aggregate, `AddMember` command, `MemberAdded` event,
     and Membership projector.
  3. Implement `list_active_members_of_club/1` and supporting queries on the
     Membership context boundary.
  4. Add Cucumber step definitions for all Background lines in both feature
     files, using the public Membership API.
  5. Run `devenv shell mix precommit` and fix any issues.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Cucumber Background of both feature files passes.
  - ExUnit covers aggregate rules, projector behaviour, and the query API.
  - `devenv shell mix precommit` passes.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - The minimal membership model will need to evolve soon (lapsed/active,
    households, renewals, privacy). That work belongs to a later iteration.
  - Iteration 003 implements Messaging on top of this API.

  > 
  > 5. **Todo splits/additions/reordering**
  >    - None.
  >

# Check iteration task list

Determine whether the current iteration todo list has any unchecked implementation tasks remaining.

Use the plan path input from the workflow:

- `docs/iterations/002-membership-model/plan.md`

Rules:

- Derive the todo path by replacing the trailing `/plan.md` with `/todo.md`.
- Read the todo file.
- If the todo file is missing, empty, or unreadable, report that as a blocking problem and set `task_list_complete` to `false` and `task_list_needs_human` to `true`.
- If any line matches an unchecked Markdown task (`- [ ] ...`), set `task_list_complete` to `false` and `task_list_needs_human` to `false`.
- If no unchecked Markdown tasks remain, set `task_list_complete` to `true` and `task_list_needs_human` to `false`.
- Do not edit files.

Return a concise explanation and end with exactly one JSON context update object.

Examples:

Unchecked tasks remain:

```json
{"context_updates":{"task_list_complete":false,"task_list_needs_human":false}}
```

All tasks complete:

```json
{"context_updates":{"task_list_complete":true,"task_list_needs_human":false}}
```

Blocking problem:

```json
{"context_updates":{"task_list_complete":false,"task_list_needs_human":true}}
```
