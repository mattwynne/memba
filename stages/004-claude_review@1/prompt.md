## Stage: read_plan
- Status: succeeded
- Handler: command
- Script: `PLAN_PATH='docs/iterations/014-member-dashboard-liveview-polish/plan.md'
if [ ! -f "$PLAN_PATH" ]; then
  echo "Plan file not found: $PLAN_PATH" >&2
  exit 1
fi
printf 'PLAN_PATH=%s\n\n' "$PLAN_PATH"
sed -n '1,260p' "$PLAN_PATH"`
- Output:
  ```
  (146 lines omitted)
     - `club-message-row`;
     - `club-message-link`;
     - `club-member-row` or equivalent accessible member data;
     - message/member data attributes needed by helpers.
  9. Remove any remaining inline compose form from club home if iteration 013 has not already done so in the branch being implemented.
  10. Add focused LiveView/Phoenix tests for:
     - signed-in active member sees dashboard;
     - signed-in non-member/inactive member receives forbidden;
     - logged-out/public club page behaviour is preserved;
     - CTA points at compose route;
     - no inline compose form;
     - message rows and links render;
     - receipt glance renders with member-facing vocabulary;
     - timestamp labels use `inserted_at` when available and are omitted when unavailable;
     - empty states render;
     - active-member card renders count/avatar stack;
     - no operator-only fields leak.
  11. Run existing browser Cucumber for member-message deliverability and `dev check`.
  
  ## Technical Decisions
  
  - Route organization: keep `GET /?club_id=<club_id>` as the user-visible address. Preserve the controller/public path for logged-out visitors and use it as the dispatcher/public rendering boundary; signed-in active members with a selected club see `MembaWeb.MemberDashboardLive` for the same URL. No separate dashboard URL is introduced in this slice.
  - Receipt glances: calculate row view data in a dedicated presentation/query helper, `MembaWeb.MemberDashboardPresentation`, using existing receipt projections and `MembaWeb.MemberReceiptPresentation` vocabulary.
  - Message row “when” metadata: use `Memba.Messaging.Projections.Message.inserted_at` as the sent/recorded timestamp. If a row has no timestamp, omit the timestamp label for that row instead of inventing data or showing “Unknown”.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Members land on a polished, LiveView-backed club dashboard that matches the remaining wireframe direction and gives quick access to compose, recent messages, and active-member context.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `dev check`.
  - Run targeted LiveView/Phoenix tests for the member dashboard.
  - Run `acceptance-tests/features/member_message_deliverability.feature` through the browser runner.
  - Manual demo:
    - sign in as Alice;
    - open Kootenay Mountaineering Club;
    - confirm the dashboard is visually aligned with `dashboard.jsx`;
    - confirm “Send club message” opens `/messages/new?club_id=<club_id>`;
    - confirm recent message rows link to message details and show receipt glances where available;
    - confirm active-member card and avatar stack;
    - confirm empty states in a brand-new club;
    - confirm no operator-only delivery details appear.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Routing `/?club_id=` between public marketing and member LiveView needs care to preserve iteration 010 auth behaviour.
  - Receipt-glance data may require efficient projection queries to avoid N+1 reads if many messages are shown.
  - Current message projections may not have sent timestamps; avoid blocking the iteration on unavailable metadata.
  - This finishes the current member messaging wireframe set; future design work should be planned as new product slices rather than more cleanup.

You are independently reviewing an iteration plan before implementation.

Use the plan text from the preceding `Read Iteration Plan` stage. Do not assume any missing details. Be strict, practical, and specific.

Review the plan against these readiness questions:

1. Goal clarity
   - Is the goal clearly articulated?
   - Does it state the user/business outcome, not just tasks?
   - Is the intended beneficiary or actor clear?

2. Scope focus
   - Is the scope focused on one coherent outcome?
   - Could the iteration be any smaller while still useful?
   - Are non-goals and boundaries clear?

3. Acceptance criteria, BDD scenario decision, and business decisions
   - Are acceptance criteria concrete, clear, complete, and objectively testable?
   - Do they cover happy paths, important edge cases, permissions, error states, and data/state changes where relevant?
   - Does the plan classify the iteration as behaviour-facing or technical/engineering?
   - For behaviour-facing or domain-policy changes, does the plan include an `## Acceptance Scenarios / Feature Files` section naming the shared Cucumber feature file(s)/scenarios that will express the rules, or an explicit rationale for why Gherkin would not add useful stakeholder-readable examples?
   - Are any business, product, policy, copy, workflow, or domain decisions still unresolved?

4. Implementation plan and technical decisions
   - Are implementation steps clear, ordered, and specific?
   - Are likely files, modules, migrations, tests, interfaces, and integration points named where useful?
   - Are data model, API, UI, workflow, integration, and background-job changes clear enough?
   - Are any technical decisions still unresolved?

5. Expected capability and validation
   - What should we be able to do after this iteration that we cannot do now?
   - How will we prove success?
   - Is there a clear stop condition?

Return a Markdown report with:

- Decision: READY or NOT READY
- Confidence: High, Medium, or Low
- Blocking gaps: numbered list
- Non-blocking improvements: numbered list
- Smallest viable iteration: your recommended smallest useful slice
- Required plan edits: concrete edits the author should make
- Validation plan: how to prove the iteration succeeded

At the end of your response, include one final JSON object for workflow routing. It must be the last thing in the response and must not be wrapped in a Markdown code fence.

Use these keys exactly so the synthesis stage can fail closed if reviewer findings are not visible in context:

- `claude_review_decision`: `READY` or `NOT READY`
- `claude_review_confidence`: `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`
- `claude_review_blocking_gap_count`: integer count of blocking gaps
- `claude_review_blocking_gaps`: concise semicolon-separated blocking gaps, or `None`
- `claude_review_required_edits`: concise semicolon-separated required edits, or `None`

Examples:

{"context_updates":{"claude_review_decision":"READY","claude_review_confidence":"High","claude_review_blocking_gap_count":0,"claude_review_blocking_gaps":"None","claude_review_required_edits":"None"}}

{"context_updates":{"claude_review_decision":"NOT READY","claude_review_confidence":"High","claude_review_blocking_gap_count":2,"claude_review_blocking_gaps":"Ordering is not decided; Acceptance criteria omit visible table columns","claude_review_required_edits":"State ordering; Define table columns and row identity"}}
