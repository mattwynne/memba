  ```
  (53 lines omitted)
  - `homepage.feature` passes through Playwright/Cucumber against the running Phoenix app.
  - Every scenario in `member_message_deliverability.feature` passes through Playwright/Cucumber against the real routes and `POST /webhooks/postmark`.
  - Browser status-change steps wait for the projected receipt/status UI to become observable instead of assuming the webhook response means all projections are already visible.
  - `operator_email_deliverability.feature` remains excluded from the default browser run while its scenarios are tagged `@todo-web`.
  - The Elixir/domain acceptance path used by `dev check` still runs all shared scenarios, including any tagged `@todo-web`.
  - Browser acceptance failures clearly identify whether the failure is from database readiness, Phoenix startup/readiness, webhook submission, LiveView/projection timing, browser interaction, or an assertion mismatch.
  - `dev check` passes.
  
  ## Open Business Decisions
  
  None known.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Inspect the current `acceptance-tests/` Playwright/Cucumber setup and the shared feature files to identify existing step coverage and gaps.
  2. Configure the browser Cucumber default command to exclude `@todo-web`, while leaving the Elixir/domain Cucumber runner unfiltered.
  3. Build or refine the browser test lifecycle wrapper so it prepares the test database, starts Phoenix, waits for HTTP readiness, captures useful logs, and tears down reliably.
  4. Implement homepage browser steps against the real homepage route.
  5. Implement member-message browser steps by driving `/clubs`, `/clubs/:club_id`, and `/messages/:message_id` through accessible labels, roles, and stable identifiers supplied by the existing UI.
  6. Implement webhook/status browser steps by sending Postmark-style HTTP requests to `POST /webhooks/postmark`.
  7. Add bounded polling/waiting around browser-visible projections after commands and webhook posts. Prefer Playwright assertions such as `expect(...).toHaveText`, `expect.poll`, or equivalent Cucumber helper retries over fixed sleeps.
  8. Make diagnostics actionable: separate errors for Phoenix readiness, database setup, webhook HTTP failures, timeout waiting for projected UI state, and final assertion mismatches.
  9. Verify that `operator_email_deliverability.feature` is excluded only from the browser run and remains covered by the domain runner.
  10. Run `npm test` in `acceptance-tests/` and `dev check`, fixing harness/step issues until both pass.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  ### Synchronization strategy for eventually consistent projections
  
  Use harness/test-level waiting by default. After a browser action or webhook POST, the step should wait for the user-observable projection in the LiveView/UI to reach the expected state with a bounded timeout and clear failure message. The webhook HTTP response should only prove that the event was accepted; it must not be treated as proof that Commanded/Ecto projections and LiveView rendering are complete.
  
  This iteration should not make production status projections strongly consistent just to simplify tests. If implementation discovers a genuine product need for stronger consistency, that must be an intentional production design decision, documented separately, with tests explaining the user-facing guarantee. Otherwise, keep production consistency semantics unchanged and make the browser harness robust against eventual projection timing.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Developers can run the shared member-facing acceptance scenarios through a real browser and a running Phoenix app, with reliable startup/teardown, clear diagnostics, and projection-aware waiting. The browser suite can distinguish web-backed scenarios from domain-only scenarios using `@todo-web` without weakening the domain acceptance coverage.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `npm test` from `acceptance-tests/` and confirm it passes with `not @todo-web` as the default browser tag expression.
  - Confirm the browser run includes `homepage.feature` and `member_message_deliverability.feature`.
  - Confirm `operator_email_deliverability.feature` remains excluded from the browser run while tagged `@todo-web`.
  - Run the Elixir/domain acceptance path used by `dev check` and confirm it still runs all shared scenarios regardless of `@todo-web`.
  - Run `dev check` and fix any failures.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - This plan depends on the iteration 005 routes and webhook endpoint being present before automation starts; if they are not merged, implementation should stop rather than creating duplicate app surfaces in this slice.
  - LiveView and projection timing may reveal race conditions in the harness. Prefer bounded, observable waits with good diagnostics over fixed sleeps.
  - Iteration 006 should remove the operator `@todo-web` deferral and add browser automation for `/deliveries` when that operator slice is implemented.

You are independently reviewing an iteration plan before implementation.

Use the plan text from the preceding `Read Iteration Plan` stage. Do not assume any missing details. Be strict, practical, and specific.

Review the plan against these readiness questions:

1. Goal clarity
   - Is the goal clearly articulated?
   - Does it state the user/business outcome, not just tasks?
   - Is the intended beneficiary or actor clear?

2. Scope focus
   - Is the scope focused on one coherent outcome?
   - Could the iteration be any smaller while still useful?
   - Are non-goals and boundaries clear?

3. Acceptance criteria and business decisions
   - Are acceptance criteria concrete, clear, complete, and objectively testable?
   - Do they cover happy paths, important edge cases, permissions, error states, and data/state changes where relevant?
   - Are any business, product, policy, copy, workflow, or domain decisions still unresolved?

4. Implementation plan and technical decisions
   - Are implementation steps clear, ordered, and specific?
   - Are likely files, modules, migrations, tests, interfaces, and integration points named where useful?
   - Are data model, API, UI, workflow, integration, and background-job changes clear enough?
   - Are any technical decisions still unresolved?

5. Expected capability and validation
   - What should we be able to do after this iteration that we cannot do now?
   - How will we prove success?
   - Is there a clear stop condition?

Return a Markdown report with:

- Decision: READY or NOT READY
- Confidence: High, Medium, or Low
- Blocking gaps: numbered list
- Non-blocking improvements: numbered list
- Smallest viable iteration: your recommended smallest useful slice
- Required plan edits: concrete edits the author should make
- Validation plan: how to prove the iteration succeeded

At the end of your response, include one final JSON object for workflow routing. It must be the last thing in the response and must not be wrapped in a Markdown code fence.

Use these keys exactly so the synthesis stage can fail closed if reviewer findings are not visible in context:

- `claude_review_decision`: `READY` or `NOT READY`
- `claude_review_confidence`: `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`
- `claude_review_blocking_gap_count`: integer count of blocking gaps
- `claude_review_blocking_gaps`: concise semicolon-separated blocking gaps, or `None`
- `claude_review_required_edits`: concise semicolon-separated required edits, or `None`

Examples:

{"context_updates":{"claude_review_decision":"READY","claude_review_confidence":"High","claude_review_blocking_gap_count":0,"claude_review_blocking_gaps":"None","claude_review_required_edits":"None"}}

{"context_updates":{"claude_review_decision":"NOT READY","claude_review_confidence":"High","claude_review_blocking_gap_count":2,"claude_review_blocking_gaps":"Ordering is not decided; Acceptance criteria omit visible table columns","claude_review_required_edits":"State ordering; Define table columns and row identity"}}
