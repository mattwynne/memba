- Output:
  ```
  (51 lines omitted)
  - Delayed, bounced, and spam complaint rows preserve the provider/channel reason text.
  - Opened deliveries are visible as `opened` after a delivered email is opened.
  - Delivered/opened rows do not show stale problem reasons.
  - `operator_email_deliverability.feature` uses deliveries-overview language and passes through the browser acceptance harness without `@todo-web` deferral.
  - `homepage.feature` and `member_message_deliverability.feature` continue to pass through the browser acceptance harness.
  - The Elixir/domain acceptance path used by `dev check` still runs the shared scenarios.
  - `dev check` passes.
  
  ## Open Business Decisions
  
  None known.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Update the operator feature language around the rule "Operators monitor detailed delivery records across messages", keeping scenarios BRIEF and focused on cross-message visibility, reason preservation, and opened status.
  2. Write failing PhoenixTest coverage for `/deliveries`, including records from more than one message and problem reason text.
  3. Reshape the public Messaging operator-deliverability query toward a deliveries-overview API, for example an options-shaped list function. Preserve any existing message-scoped needs through options or a compatibility wrapper only if still required by current code.
  4. Add the `/deliveries` LiveView route under the browser pipeline.
  5. Build the deliveries LiveView as a simple read-only table with stable accessible labels or IDs for browser acceptance.
  6. Update browser Cucumber step definitions for `operator_email_deliverability.feature` so operator assertions inspect `/deliveries`.
  7. Remove `@todo-web` tags from operator scenarios once they are browser-backed.
  8. Verify browser Cucumber still defaults to excluding `@todo-web`, while now including the operator scenarios because they are no longer tagged.
  9. Run the browser acceptance suite and `dev check`, fixing any issues.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  None known. The intended technical shape is:
  
  - `/deliveries` is the operator overview route for delivery records across messages.
  - The query API is deliveries-overview oriented and options-shaped for later filtering/pagination.
  - This iteration may return an unpaginated list if that is the smallest working slice, but should order deterministically, preferably newest or most recently updated first.
  - Pagination/infinite scroll is explicitly deferred, not half-implemented.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Operators can inspect a single browser page showing detailed delivery records across messages, including problem reasons, instead of relying only on domain-level tests or message-scoped read models.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `npm test` from `acceptance-tests/` and confirm operator deliverability scenarios now run and pass through the browser acceptance harness.
  - Run PhoenixTest-based LiveView tests for the deliveries page/table.
  - Run the Elixir/domain acceptance path used by `dev check` and confirm it still runs the shared scenarios.
  - Run `dev check` and fix any failures.
  - Manual demo: start the Phoenix app, create a club with members, send at least two messages, POST Postmark-style delayed/bounced/spam/opened events, visit `/deliveries`, and see all delivery records in one table with statuses and reason text.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - The unfiltered table is intentionally minimal; filtering, search, pagination, infinite scroll, and exports should be planned as later slices once the overview shape proves useful.
  - The existing projection may not contain message title/subject in the most convenient form for an all-deliveries view; keep any projection/query changes narrow and backward-compatible with existing domain behaviour.
  - Authentication and operator permissions remain deferred and must be addressed before exposing this surface in a real multi-user setting.

You are independently reviewing an iteration plan before implementation.

Use the plan text from the preceding `Read Iteration Plan` stage. Do not assume any missing details. Be strict, practical, and specific.

Review the plan against these readiness questions:

1. Goal clarity
   - Is the goal clearly articulated?
   - Does it state the user/business outcome, not just tasks?
   - Is the intended beneficiary or actor clear?

2. Scope focus
   - Is the scope focused on one coherent outcome?
   - Could the iteration be any smaller while still useful?
   - Are non-goals and boundaries clear?

3. Acceptance criteria and business decisions
   - Are acceptance criteria concrete, clear, complete, and objectively testable?
   - Do they cover happy paths, important edge cases, permissions, error states, and data/state changes where relevant?
   - Are any business, product, policy, copy, workflow, or domain decisions still unresolved?

4. Implementation plan and technical decisions
   - Are implementation steps clear, ordered, and specific?
   - Are likely files, modules, migrations, tests, interfaces, and integration points named where useful?
   - Are data model, API, UI, workflow, integration, and background-job changes clear enough?
   - Are any technical decisions still unresolved?

5. Expected capability and validation
   - What should we be able to do after this iteration that we cannot do now?
   - How will we prove success?
   - Is there a clear stop condition?

Return a Markdown report with:

- Decision: READY or NOT READY
- Confidence: High, Medium, or Low
- Blocking gaps: numbered list
- Non-blocking improvements: numbered list
- Smallest viable iteration: your recommended smallest useful slice
- Required plan edits: concrete edits the author should make
- Validation plan: how to prove the iteration succeeded

At the end of your response, include one final JSON object for workflow routing. It must be the last thing in the response and must not be wrapped in a Markdown code fence.

Use these keys exactly so the synthesis stage can fail closed if reviewer findings are not visible in context:

- `claude_review_decision`: `READY` or `NOT READY`
- `claude_review_confidence`: `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`
- `claude_review_blocking_gap_count`: integer count of blocking gaps
- `claude_review_blocking_gaps`: concise semicolon-separated blocking gaps, or `None`
- `claude_review_required_edits`: concise semicolon-separated required edits, or `None`

Examples:

{"context_updates":{"claude_review_decision":"READY","claude_review_confidence":"High","claude_review_blocking_gap_count":0,"claude_review_blocking_gaps":"None","claude_review_required_edits":"None"}}

{"context_updates":{"claude_review_decision":"NOT READY","claude_review_confidence":"High","claude_review_blocking_gap_count":2,"claude_review_blocking_gaps":"Ordering is not decided; Acceptance criteria omit visible table columns","claude_review_required_edits":"State ordering; Define table columns and row identity"}}
