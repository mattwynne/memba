     - subject/body inputs using Phoenix form components;
     - “Send to all members” primary action and cancel/back action.
  7. Render success state based on `ComposeSuccess`, adding the required “Send another message” action.
  8. Render failure state based on `ComposeError`, adjusted to say nothing was sent and contact support; include Try again and Back to club home actions.
  9. Add or update LiveView/Phoenix tests for:
     - auth and selected-club requirements;
     - no sender dropdown;
     - sender derived from current member;
     - successful submit and success action links;
     - send failure state and support copy;
     - club home CTA replacing inline compose.
  10. Update acceptance step support only as needed for the new send-failure scenario and for existing normal-send steps to use the new compose flow without changing scenario wording.
      - Simulate send unavailability through test support rather than Gherkin wording. Prefer a test-only configuration seam around the existing message sending/delivery boundary (for example an application-env flag or fake-provider failure mode set by step support) so the feature can say only that sending is unavailable.
  11. Remove `@wip` from the new failure scenario once implemented and passing.
  12. Remove the legacy `POST /?club_id=<club_id>` send route and controller action in this slice once the LiveView submit path is covered. Do not keep a parallel member send endpoint unless a test reveals an existing non-UI caller that must be preserved.
  13. Run the targeted browser Cucumber feature and `dev check`.
  
  ## Technical Decisions
  
  - LiveView module: `MembaWeb.MemberMessageLive.New`.
  - Compose path: `GET /messages/new?club_id=<club_id>`; use Phoenix verified routes (`~p`) in implementation/tests.
  - Send-unavailability simulation: add/use a test-support seam around the sending boundary or fake provider configuration, configured by step support, without exposing infrastructure details in Gherkin.
  - Legacy inline send endpoint: remove the old `POST /?club_id=<club_id>` route/controller action once the LiveView submit path replaces it.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Members have a focused, calmer compose experience with clear post-send choices. Messages are sent as the logged-in member, and failure is treated as an incident with support guidance rather than a confusing form validation problem.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `dev check`.
  - Run targeted LiveView/Phoenix tests for the compose LiveView and club-home CTA.
  - Run `acceptance-tests/features/member_message_deliverability.feature` through the browser runner.
  - Manual demo:
    - sign in as Alice;
    - open Kootenay Mountaineering Club;
    - click “Send club message”;
    - confirm compose screen has no sender dropdown and shows Alice as sender;
    - send “Trip planning night”;
    - confirm success state shows “See who got it”, “Send another message”, and “Back to home”;
    - follow “See who got it” to the message detail page;
    - return and use “Send another message” to start a fresh compose;
    - simulate send failure and confirm the message was not sent, support guidance appears, and Try again/Home actions are available.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Existing browser helpers may assume the inline form exists; update helpers while keeping feature language business-focused.
  - Error simulation needs a clean test seam so the new Gherkin does not become infrastructure-specific.
  - Removing the sender dropdown changes a product affordance that existed accidentally; tests should make the new rule explicit.
  - Dashboard polish remains a future iteration.

  - [x] 001 Inspect the current club-home form, `PageController.send_message/2`, member auth plugs, route tests, and browser acceptance helpers for member message sending.
  - [x] 002 Introduce `MembaWeb.MemberMessageLive.New`, routed at `GET /messages/new` through the existing browser/member auth pipeline. Use the route helper/path `~p"/messages/new?club_id=#{club.id}"` in templates/tests rather than inventing a bespoke named helper.
  - [ ] 003 In the LiveView mount path:
  - [ ] 004 Replace the club-home inline compose section with a CTA card/link to the new compose route. Preserve stable IDs or update tests/helpers deliberately.
  - [ ] 005 Move sending behaviour into the LiveView submit event or a small shared service function:
  - [ ] 006 Render compose form based on `compose.jsx`:
  - [ ] 007 Render success state based on `ComposeSuccess`, adding the required “Send another message” action.
  - [ ] 008 Render failure state based on `ComposeError`, adjusted to say nothing was sent and contact support; include Try again and Back to club home actions.
  - [ ] 009 Add or update LiveView/Phoenix tests for:

  > ### Decision
  > **VALID**
  > 
  > ### Evidence
  > - Completed todo/check-off evidence found:
  >   - Working tree has no tracked diff; current HEAD is a Fabro `pre_validate_snapshot` checkpoint, with the implementation in recent checkpoint `56a913a`.
  >   - `git show 56a913a -- docs/iterations/013-member-compose-liveview-flow/todo.md` shows exactly task `002` changed from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`.
  >   - The parent of `56a913a` had task `001` checked and task `002` as the first unchecked task, so the completed task matches the next planned slice.
  > - Implementation artifacts found:
  >   - Added `web/lib/memba_web/live/member_message_live/new.ex` defining `MembaWeb.MemberMessageLive.New`.
  >   - Updated `web/lib/memba_web/router.ex` with `live "/messages/new", MemberMessageLive.New, :new` inside the existing `[:browser, :club_member_required]` member LiveView session.
  >   - Added/updated tests in:
  >     - `web/test/memba_web/live/member_message_live/new_test.exs`
  >     - `web/test/memba_web/router_test.exs`
  >   - The LiveView test uses the required verified route shape: `~p"/messages/new?club_id=#{alice.club_id}"`.
  > - Tests run/results found:
  >   - Implementation summary reported `PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH" dev check` passed with `233 tests, 0 failures`.
  >   - I reran `PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH" dev check`; it passed with `233 tests, 0 failures`.
  > - ADR/plan conformance notes:
  >   - No accepted ADR files were found in the repository, so no ADR conflict was identified.
  >   - The work matches plan task `002`: it introduces the compose LiveView route through the member-authenticated browser pipeline and adds focused route/LiveView tests.
  >   - No acceptance feature files were edited in this checkpoint, consistent with the task scope and allowed feature-change rules.
  >   - Later mount/form/send behavior remains deferred to subsequent explicit todo items; this slice stands independently.

  - [x] 001 Inspect the current club-home form, `PageController.send_message/2`, member auth plugs, route tests, and browser acceptance helpers for member message sending.
  - [x] 002 Introduce `MembaWeb.MemberMessageLive.New`, routed at `GET /messages/new` through the existing browser/member auth pipeline. Use the route helper/path `~p"/messages/new?club_id=#{club.id}"` in templates/tests rather than inventing a bespoke named helper.
  - [ ] 003 In the LiveView mount path:
  - [ ] 004 Replace the club-home inline compose section with a CTA card/link to the new compose route. Preserve stable IDs or update tests/helpers deliberately.
  - [ ] 005 Move sending behaviour into the LiveView submit event or a small shared service function:
  - [ ] 006 Render compose form based on `compose.jsx`:
  - [ ] 007 Render success state based on `ComposeSuccess`, adding the required “Send another message” action.
  - [ ] 008 Render failure state based on `ComposeError`, adjusted to say nothing was sent and contact support; include Try again and Back to club home actions.
  - [ ] 009 Add or update LiveView/Phoenix tests for:
  - [ ] 010 Update acceptance step support only as needed for the new send-failure scenario and for existing normal-send steps to use the new compose flow without changing scenario wording.
  - [ ] 011 Remove `@wip` from the new failure scenario once implemented and passing.
  - [ ] 012 Remove the legacy `POST /?club_id=<club_id>` send route and controller action in this slice once the LiveView submit path is covered. Do not keep a parallel member send endpoint unless a test reveals an existing non-UI caller that must be preserved.
  - [ ] 013 Run the targeted browser Cucumber feature and `dev check`.

Implement the next unchecked iteration task from `todo.md`.

Plan path: `docs/iterations/013-member-compose-liveview-flow/plan.md`.
Todo path is derived from the plan path by replacing `/plan.md` with `/todo.md`.

## Ownership rules

- Read the plan and `todo.md` before editing.
- Pick the first unchecked Markdown task line in `todo.md` (`- [ ] ...`). That task is yours from selection through check-off.
- Treat earlier checked todo lines as durable completed work. Do not redo them.
- Inspect recent Fabro checkpoint commits with `git log --oneline --decorate -20` and use their subjects/bodies/diffs as context for what previous runs already completed.
- Inspect `git status --short` before editing. The resume gate should normally guarantee a clean tree; if uncommitted changes are present, stop for human input unless they are clearly the selected task's in-progress work and you can safely continue it to completion without overwriting it.
- Never silently overwrite, discard, or duplicate uncommitted work for an unchecked task.
- Implement exactly the selected task only. Do not opportunistically implement later tasks unless the selected task cannot be completed without splitting/reordering the todo list first.
- When the implementation and focused validation are complete, check off the same task line you implemented by changing that one line from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`.
- Do not check off any other ordinary todo line.
- Do not commit manually. Fabro will checkpoint your changes automatically after this node; independent validation will inspect that checkpoint evidence.


## Local reference docs

- Prefer local project documentation over network lookups. Do not `curl` upstream docs unless the local docs are missing or clearly insufficient.
- Start with `docs/tools/README.md` for library documentation signposts. Relevant local docs include:
  - `docs/tools/commanded/README.md` for Commanded.
  - `docs/tools/commanded-eventstore-adapter/README.md` for the EventStore adapter.
  - `docs/tools/eventstore/README.md` for EventStore.
  - `docs/tools/commanded-ecto-projections/README.md` for projections.
  - `docs/tools/cucumber/README.md` for Elixir Cucumber.
  - `docs/tools/ecto/README.md` and `docs/tools/ecto-sql/README.md` for Ecto.
  - `docs/tools/phoenix/README.md` and related Phoenix docs for web framework work.
- If you need examples, search the local `web/deps/` source tree and `docs/tools/` before using the network.

## Binding rules

- `plan.md` remains the source of truth. `todo.md` is derived execution state.
- You may split the selected task into smaller unchecked tasks, add required technical subtasks, or reorder pending tasks only to satisfy the approved plan.
- If the selected task is too large, split it in `todo.md`, leave the parent/current task unchecked or replace it with smaller unchecked tasks, then implement and check off only the first newly available slice.
- You may not delete, weaken, or silently defer plan-required work.
- Before editing, read every ADR explicitly referenced by the plan and inspect nearby/current ADRs under `docs/adr/` when relevant.
- Treat accepted ADRs as binding architecture constraints.
- Use test-driven development for behaviour changes.
- Add or update automated tests proving the selected task's behaviour/configuration.
- Run focused validation appropriate to the selected task and capture the commands/results in your response.
- Acceptance feature files (`*.feature`, including files under `acceptance-tests/`) are locked unless the plan has a `## Allowed acceptance feature changes` section naming the exact file and allowed kind of change. If the plan permits a feature edit, make only that explicit edit and preserve/validate the coverage promised by the plan. If a feature file appears wrong, stale, or insufficient without explicit permission, stop and report the issue.
- Add acceptance step definitions only where the plan explicitly requires executable plumbing for shared feature files.
- Use Req for HTTP requests; do not introduce HTTPoison, Tesla, or `:httpc`.
- Follow relevant project guidance for Phoenix, LiveView, HEEx, Tailwind, Ecto, Elixir, Mix, and tests.
- If you hit a real blocker, stop and report it clearly without checking off the task.

When finished, summarize:

1. Selected todo line and task text.
2. Code/config/test/doc changes made for this task only.
3. Focused validation commands run and results.
4. The exact todo check-off you made.
5. Any todo splits/additions/reordering and why they still satisfy the plan.
6. ADR conformance evidence for this task.
