  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Use TDD with PhoenixTest as the preferred high-level LiveView test API. Start by writing failing PhoenixTest coverage for the real route flows listed in the acceptance criteria.
  2. Add browser routes under the existing browser pipeline:
     - `live "/clubs", ClubsLive.Index`;
     - `live "/clubs/:club_id", ClubsLive.Show`;
     - `live "/messages/:message_id", MessagesLive.Show`.
  3. Add `POST /webhooks/postmark` under an appropriate non-browser pipeline for webhook requests.
  4. Add thin public context APIs following the existing pattern rather than dispatching Commanded commands from the web layer directly:
     - `Memba.Membership.create_club/1`, `create_person/1`, and `add_member/1` for the LiveViews;
     - `Memba.Messaging.report_delivery_delivered/1`, `report_delivery_delayed/1`, `report_delivery_bounced/1`, `report_delivery_spam_complaint/1`, and `report_delivery_opened/1` for the Postmark webhook.
  5. Build `MembaWeb.ClubsLive.Index`, `MembaWeb.ClubsLive.Show`, and `MembaWeb.MessagesLive.Show` with simple forms/actions for club creation, person creation, membership, club message sending, and receipt viewing.
  6. Build the Postmark webhook controller/handler to parse Postmark-style event payloads and call the public Messaging status-reporting functions.
  7. Give important forms, controls, rows, and status displays stable IDs or accessible labels suitable for Playwright and PhoenixTest.
  8. Update Playwright/Cucumber step definitions to drive the real LiveView routes for `homepage.feature` and `member_message_deliverability.feature`; delivery/open report steps should make HTTP requests to `POST /webhooks/postmark`.
  9. Add `@todo-web` tags to operator deliverability scenarios that are intentionally not browser-backed in this iteration.
  10. Configure `acceptance-tests/cucumber.js` so the default browser Cucumber command uses `tags: "not @todo-web"`.
  11. Verify the Elixir/domain acceptance path used by `dev check` still runs every shared scenario regardless of `@todo-web` tags.
  12. Run the browser acceptance suite and `dev check`, fixing any issues.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  None known. The technical shape is:
  
  - separate real LiveView routes, not a single developer harness page;
  - thin public context APIs, not direct Commanded dispatch from LiveViews/controllers;
  - Postmark-shaped webhook endpoint now, with provider hardening deferred;
  - browser Cucumber excludes `@todo-web` with `not @todo-web`, while the domain acceptance path used by `dev check` runs all scenarios.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Developers/operators can use real browser routes to exercise and inspect the member-facing behaviours that are currently only implemented and validated at the domain/application layer. The application also has an initial Postmark-shaped webhook endpoint that turns provider delivery/open events into Messaging status commands. The shared acceptance feature files can partition browser-ready scenarios from browser-deferred scenarios with `@todo-web` while continuing to validate the full domain behaviour separately.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `npm test` from `acceptance-tests/` and confirm it uses `not @todo-web`, runs browser-ready scenarios only, and passes.
  - Confirm `@todo-web` excludes operator deliverability scenarios from the browser acceptance run.
  - Run the Elixir/domain acceptance path used by `dev check` and confirm it still runs all shared scenarios, including `@todo-web` scenarios.
  - Run PhoenixTest-based LiveView tests proving all member-facing route flows and receipt-status updates.
  - Run `dev check` and fix any failures.
  - Manual demo: start the Phoenix app, create clubs/people/members, send a club message, inspect addressed recipients/delivery records, POST Postmark-style delivered/delayed/bounced/spam/opened events, and see the member receipt status update.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - The minimal browser surface may reveal gaps in existing query APIs needed by LiveView. Keep any additions narrowly focused on exposing already-implemented behaviour through public contexts.
  - The routes are intended as real product substrate, but visual design and interaction polish are deferred to a later design iteration.
  - The Postmark webhook shape may need adjustment during the later provider integration iteration when signature verification, retries, and exact production payload details are added.
  - Operator deliverability browser UI remains deferred behind `@todo-web` and should be planned as a later slice.

## Current context

| task_list_needs_human | false |


Implement the next unchecked iteration task from `todo.md`.

Plan path: `docs/iterations/005-browser-acceptance-harness/plan.md`.
Todo path is derived from the plan path by replacing `/plan.md` with `/todo.md`.

## Ownership rules

- Read the plan and `todo.md` before editing.
- Pick the first unchecked Markdown task line in `todo.md` (`- [ ] ...`). That task is yours from selection through check-off.
- Treat earlier checked todo lines as durable completed work. Do not redo them.
- Inspect recent Fabro checkpoint commits with `git log --oneline --decorate -20` and use their subjects/bodies/diffs as context for what previous runs already completed.
- Inspect `git status --short` before editing. The resume gate should normally guarantee a clean tree; if uncommitted changes are present, stop for human input unless they are clearly the selected task's in-progress work and you can safely continue it to completion without overwriting it.
- Never silently overwrite, discard, or duplicate uncommitted work for an unchecked task.
- Implement exactly the selected task only. Do not opportunistically implement later tasks unless the selected task cannot be completed without splitting/reordering the todo list first.
- When the implementation and focused validation are complete, check off the same task line you implemented by changing that one line from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`.
- Do not check off any other ordinary todo line.
- Do not commit manually. Fabro will checkpoint your changes automatically after this node; independent validation will inspect that checkpoint evidence.


## Local reference docs

- Prefer local project documentation over network lookups. Do not `curl` upstream docs unless the local docs are missing or clearly insufficient.
- Start with `docs/tools/README.md` for library documentation signposts. Relevant local docs include:
  - `docs/tools/commanded/README.md` for Commanded.
  - `docs/tools/commanded-eventstore-adapter/README.md` for the EventStore adapter.
  - `docs/tools/eventstore/README.md` for EventStore.
  - `docs/tools/commanded-ecto-projections/README.md` for projections.
  - `docs/tools/cucumber/README.md` for Elixir Cucumber.
  - `docs/tools/ecto/README.md` and `docs/tools/ecto-sql/README.md` for Ecto.
  - `docs/tools/phoenix/README.md` and related Phoenix docs for web framework work.
- If you need examples, search the local `web/deps/` source tree and `docs/tools/` before using the network.

## Binding rules

- `plan.md` remains the source of truth. `todo.md` is derived execution state.
- You may split the selected task into smaller unchecked tasks, add required technical subtasks, or reorder pending tasks only to satisfy the approved plan.
- If the selected task is too large, split it in `todo.md`, leave the parent/current task unchecked or replace it with smaller unchecked tasks, then implement and check off only the first newly available slice.
- You may not delete, weaken, or silently defer plan-required work.
- Before editing, read every ADR explicitly referenced by the plan and inspect nearby/current ADRs under `docs/adr/` when relevant.
- Treat accepted ADRs as binding architecture constraints.
- Use test-driven development for behaviour changes.
- Add or update automated tests proving the selected task's behaviour/configuration.
- Run focused validation appropriate to the selected task and capture the commands/results in your response.
- Never edit acceptance feature files (`*.feature`, including files under `acceptance-tests/`). If a feature file appears wrong, stale, or insufficient, stop and report the issue.
- Add acceptance step definitions only where the plan explicitly requires executable plumbing for locked shared feature files.
- Use Req for HTTP requests; do not introduce HTTPoison, Tesla, or `:httpc`.
- Follow relevant project guidance for Phoenix, LiveView, HEEx, Tailwind, Ecto, Elixir, Mix, and tests.
- If you hit a real blocker, stop and report it clearly without checking off the task.

When finished, summarize:

1. Selected todo line and task text.
2. Code/config/test/doc changes made for this task only.
3. Focused validation commands run and results.
4. The exact todo check-off you made.
5. Any todo splits/additions/reordering and why they still satisfy the plan.
6. ADR conformance evidence for this task.
