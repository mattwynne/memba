  (67 lines omitted)
  - Any delivery, status, receipt, or operator-view modelling.
  - Making the rest of the shared feature scenarios pass.
  - Phoenix UI, real provider integration, webhooks, tracking pixels.
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  
  - `mix deps.get` resolves the new dependencies and the app boots in dev and
    test.
  - The EventStore is initialised in its dedicated schema; running tests resets
    it cleanly.
  - Sending `CreateClub` causes a Club to be queryable through the public
    Membership query API.
  - Cucumber executes from the Phoenix test suite against the shared feature
    files and the chosen Background step passes.
  - No CRUD-spike Membership context, schema, migration, or test remains where
    it conflicts with the event-sourced design.
  - `devenv shell mix precommit` passes.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Add the dependencies above with compatible versions; lock them in
     `mix.lock`.
  2. Configure EventStore (dedicated schema) and `commanded_ecto_projections`
     in `config/*.exs`.
  3. Add `mix` aliases / test helpers so EventStore + projection tables are
     created and reset in dev and test.
  4. Add `Memba.Membership.App` and `Memba.Membership.Router`.
  5. Add the `Club` aggregate, `CreateClub` command, and `ClubCreated` event,
     with caller-supplied UUID identity.
  6. Add the Club projector and a public `Memba.Membership.get_club/1`
     read-side function.
  7. Add Cucumber configuration that reads `acceptance-tests/features/**/*.feature`
     and a single step definition for the chosen Background step.
  8. Remove conflicting CRUD spike code.
  9. Run `devenv shell mix precommit` and fix any issues.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - ExUnit tests cover the Club aggregate, `ClubCreated` projector, and a
    minimal EventStore smoke test.
  - Cucumber runs from the Phoenix test suite and the chosen Background step
    passes against the live event-sourced stack.
  - `devenv shell mix precommit` passes.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - EventStore + projections setup may surface package-version or migration
    lifecycle issues. Resolving them here is the whole point of this slice.
  - Iteration 002 adds Person and Membership aggregates and completes the
    Background of both shared feature files.

## Current context

| task_list_complete | false |
| task_list_needs_human | false |


Implement the next unchecked iteration task from `todo.md`.

Plan path: `docs/iterations/001-event-sourced-foundation/plan.md`.
Todo path is derived from the plan path by replacing `/plan.md` with `/todo.md`.

## Ownership rules

- Read the plan and `todo.md` before editing.
- Pick the first unchecked Markdown task line in `todo.md` (`- [ ] ...`). That task is yours from selection through check-off.
- Treat earlier checked todo lines as durable completed work. Do not redo them.
- Inspect recent task commits with `git log --oneline --decorate -20` and use their subjects/bodies as context for what previous runs already completed.
- Inspect `git status --short` before editing. The resume gate should normally guarantee a clean tree; if uncommitted changes are present, stop for human input unless they are clearly the selected task's in-progress work and you can safely continue it to completion without overwriting it.
- Never silently overwrite, discard, or duplicate uncommitted work for an unchecked task.
- Implement exactly the selected task only. Do not opportunistically implement later tasks unless the selected task cannot be completed without splitting/reordering the todo list first.
- When the implementation and focused validation are complete, check off the same task line you implemented by changing that one line from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`.
- Do not check off any other ordinary todo line.
- Do not commit. The deterministic commit node will commit after independent validation.


## Local reference docs

- Prefer local project documentation over network lookups. Do not `curl` upstream docs unless the local docs are missing or clearly insufficient.
- Start with `docs/tools/README.md` for library documentation signposts. Relevant local docs include:
  - `docs/tools/commanded/README.md` for Commanded.
  - `docs/tools/commanded-eventstore-adapter/README.md` for the EventStore adapter.
  - `docs/tools/eventstore/README.md` for EventStore.
  - `docs/tools/commanded-ecto-projections/README.md` for projections.
  - `docs/tools/cucumber/README.md` for Elixir Cucumber.
  - `docs/tools/ecto/README.md` and `docs/tools/ecto-sql/README.md` for Ecto.
  - `docs/tools/phoenix/README.md` and related Phoenix docs for web framework work.
- If you need examples, search the local `web/deps/` source tree and `docs/tools/` before using the network.

## Binding rules

- `plan.md` remains the source of truth. `todo.md` is derived execution state.
- You may split the selected task into smaller unchecked tasks, add required technical subtasks, or reorder pending tasks only to satisfy the approved plan.
- If the selected task is too large, split it in `todo.md`, leave the parent/current task unchecked or replace it with smaller unchecked tasks, then implement and check off only the first newly available slice.
- You may not delete, weaken, or silently defer plan-required work.
- Before editing, read every ADR explicitly referenced by the plan and inspect nearby/current ADRs under `docs/adr/` when relevant.
- Treat accepted ADRs as binding architecture constraints.
- Use test-driven development for behaviour changes.
- Add or update automated tests proving the selected task's behaviour/configuration.
- Run focused validation appropriate to the selected task and capture the commands/results in your response.
- Never edit acceptance feature files (`*.feature`, including files under `acceptance-tests/`). If a feature file appears wrong, stale, or insufficient, stop and report the issue.
- Add acceptance step definitions only where the plan explicitly requires executable plumbing for locked shared feature files.
- Use Req for HTTP requests; do not introduce HTTPoison, Tesla, or `:httpc`.
- Follow relevant project guidance for Phoenix, LiveView, HEEx, Tailwind, Ecto, Elixir, Mix, and tests.
- If you hit a real blocker, stop and report it clearly without checking off the task.

When finished, summarize:

1. Selected todo line and task text.
2. Code/config/test/doc changes made for this task only.
3. Focused validation commands run and results.
4. The exact todo check-off you made.
5. Any todo splits/additions/reordering and why they still satisfy the plan.
6. ADR conformance evidence for this task.
