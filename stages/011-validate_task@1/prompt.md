  (58 lines omitted)
  - `design-system/templates/club-group-members.html`: ordinary member rows, Add member action and picker.
  - `design-system/templates/club-group-non-member.html`: outside-admin Members view and Add yourself action.
  - `design-system/emails/group-welcome.html`: welcome email, with authenticated group link and no replay of old mail.
  - `design-system/explorations/custom-groups-prototype.html`: reviewed final interactions.
  
  Omit removal/leave controls until 064. Group Members shows Add member in the sole contextual tab action position. Outside admin sees no Conversations or New message until actually added; Add yourself is explained as opting into history and emails. Use normal member rows even for one member. No invented joined dates or group-admin badges. Keep club invitation flow separate; custom-group Add member does not create people. Local designs are sufficient; cloud sync remains pending.
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  
  - Every active group member can add another active member of that club, regardless of their club-admin role.
  - Any active club admin can manage additions in any custom group, including self-add, without reading conversations or joining as a side effect of adding someone else.
  - A regular club member outside the group cannot self-add, add another person or use a forged action to bypass the rule.
  - Pending invitees, former members and members of another club are not eligible. The action never creates or restores club membership.
  - New membership gives the whole history and write participation immediately; the welcome email links to the authenticated group page. Old conversation emails are not resent.
  - Repeating an already-applied addition does not create another membership transition or repeat its welcome. A genuine later re-add sends a new welcome but does not restore old follows cleared on departure.
  - Everyone and Admin retain automatic/role-based membership. The custom-group API cannot grant a club-admin role or bypass system-group rules.
  - Existing group recipients exclude nonmember admins; additions and permissions refresh in open views.
  
  ## Open Business Decisions
  
  None known. Deliver the welcome to the member's existing verified primary email; use the existing provider-neutral mailer/sender conventions and group-branded content. No new preferences or special delivery-status screen is introduced.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Add a public authenticated custom-group admission use case and actor-bearing command handled by `Membership.Club`. Evaluate actor active club membership, actor group membership or existing admin permission, target active membership and custom-group identity against current aggregate state. Preserve trusted system-group commands rather than exposing them directly to web callers.
  2. Reuse `GroupMemberAdded` and the existing projection. Make duplicate addition an idempotent no-op and carry sufficient actor/new-transition information for the welcome use case. Respect the departure/rejoin cleanup introduced in 062; no projection-only mutation or restoration shortcut.
  3. Extend `MemberDashboardPresentation`, shared member components and the group Members surface with the picker and admin self-add. Use explicit component attributes/slots, not a copied full-page template. Query candidates through Membership's public API, reauthorize on submit and render fresh membership after a successful transition.
  4. Add a small provider-neutral group-welcome composer using `Memba.EmailTemplates` and the existing `Memba.Mailer` handoff conventions. Send only after a confirmed new membership transition, not on projection replay, duplicate requests or ordinary group reads. Keep provider side effects out of aggregates/projectors; committed membership must not be represented as rolled back if delivery fails. Reuse default operational/error handling; do not build a notification framework, bespoke retry UI or delivery-status feature.
  5. Implement the tagged admission/history scenarios, including outside-admin self-add, duplicate additions, inactive/cross-club targets and system-group bypass attempts. Test replay does not resend welcomes, already-open views update, and existing invitation/role behaviour is unchanged. Run `dev check` on the exact delivery state.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  No new aggregate is needed. Use explicit per-use-case command results or new-event metadata to distinguish a new addition from an idempotent no-op; never infer that distinction by racing a projection preflight. Use the existing mailer abstraction and primary-email API instead of a new provider dependency. The welcome route is a normal group URL requiring sign-in, not a token granting membership.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  A group can grow through its own members without involving a club admin; an admin can join or populate it explicitly without gaining hidden access beforehand.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Planning parser and runner-debt checks; stakeholder review completed during discovery and prototype review.
  - Aggregate tests for actor/target/club identity, current permission, duplicates and concurrent changes.
  - Membership/Messaging integration for history and normal email eligibility with no replay of historic conversation emails.
  - Mailer tests for content, recipient, group link, a new transition versus duplicate/replay, using the test adapter rather than real email.
  - Browser demo: Bob adds Carol; Dan adds Eve without joining; Dan adds himself; ordinary outsider cannot add anyone; role/system regressions.
  - Both Cucumber runners and full `dev check` on the final delivery state.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  The raw group commands currently serve trusted policies/backfills and are not a safe web authorization API. Do not expose them unchanged. Welcome delivery cannot undo membership: avoid conflating domain success and provider outcome. Leave/removal and their controls are intentionally deferred to 064; club-departure safety already exists from 062.

- Response:
  > Task 014 is implemented and ready for independent review. I preserved the complete candidate from the prior failed Fabro checkpoint (`bd22d3f`) and found no corrective code changes necessary.
  > 
  > Changes for this task:
  > 
  > - Enabled the iteration-063 rules in [custom_group_membership.feature](/workspace/memba/acceptance-tests/features/custom_group_membership.feature:11) and [custom_group_lifecycle.feature](/workspace/memba/acceptance-tests/features/custom_group_lifecycle.feature:33), while leaving iteration-064 scenarios disabled.
  > - Added browser and domain step definitions covering:
  >   - Group-member additions.
  >   - Outside-admin add-other and self-add.
  >   - Duplicate idempotency and one welcome.
  >   - Ordinary outsider denial, including forged LiveView actions.
  >   - Pending, inactive, and cross-club target rejection.
  >   - Admin system-group bypass rejection.
  >   - Whole-history access, welcome links, and explicit re-add behavior.
  > - Added runner-selection coverage in [cucumber_config.test.js](/workspace/memba/acceptance-tests/test/cucumber_config.test.js:254).
  > - Added domain scenario execution coverage in [custom_group_membership_steps_test.exs](/workspace/memba/web/test/features/custom_group_membership_steps_test.exs:1) and extended [custom_group_lifecycle_steps_test.exs](/workspace/memba/web/test/features/custom_group_lifecycle_steps_test.exs:22).
  > - Narrowed existing generic direct-action patterns so the new admission steps resolve without ambiguity.

  > - `PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH" dev test test/features/custom_group_membership_steps_test.exs test/features/custom_group_lifecycle_steps_test.exs`
  >   - 16 tests, 0 failures.
  > - `node --test --test-name-pattern='iteration 063|default browser Cucumber profile' test/cucumber_config.test.js`
  >   - 4 tests passed.
  > - `PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH" dev acceptance --tags '@iteration-063'`
  >   - 12 scenarios passed, 96 steps passed.
  > - `mix format --check-formatted` on all touched Elixir test and step-definition files passed.

Independently review the candidate task for `docs/iterations/063-add-custom-group-members/plan.md`. Do not edit files.

Decide from live repository state, not from summarized context alone. Read the plan and its `todo.md`, inspect `git status --short`, working-tree/staged diffs, recent Fabro checkpoint commits and the relevant changed files. The candidate is the first unchecked task, identified in the preceding implementation or revision summary. It must remain unchecked until accepted. If the task identity or state is ambiguous, return `blocked` rather than approving a different task.

Fabro checkpoints candidate work after every node. A clean working tree means work may already be saved, not that it is accepted or absent. Review the full candidate, including earlier attempts and the latest revision; do not restrict review to the last checkpoint's diff. On revision, check the previous review's gaps as well as regressions introduced by the correction.

## Acceptance criteria

Accept only if all are true:

- The first pending task has concrete code/config/test/documentation evidence appropriate to its scope; a todo-only change is not implementation.
- The work satisfies the approved plan and relevant accepted ADRs.
- Any todo splits/additions/reordering preserve required scope, and the candidate is the first resulting pending slice. No required work was deleted, weakened, checked off prematurely or silently deferred.
- Relevant automated tests were added/updated and focused validation passed. A reported blocker is evidence for revision or escalation, not acceptance.
- Ordinary browser-facing tasks have focused browser/component/JS/CSS evidence appropriate to the change; do not require a duplicate full `dev check` solely because the task changes UI, routing, or acceptance support. The deterministic final gate still must pass before publication. If this task explicitly requires a full final-validation run, require its successful exit evidence before accepting the task; passing scenario counts without a final exit status do not prove the gate passed.
- Acceptance feature files (`*.feature`, including under `acceptance-tests/`) were not edited unless the plan's `## Allowed acceptance feature changes` section names the exact file and allowed kind of change. Any permitted edit stays within that permission and preserves the promised coverage.
- The task is a small, independently useful slice with a checkpoint evidence trail.

## Verdict

Return one JSON object matching the supplied schema, with exactly these fields:

- `decision`: `accept`, `revise`, or `blocked`.
- `task`: the exact selected unchecked todo line, including its `- [ ]` prefix and task text.
- `reason`: concise evidence from files, tests and plan/ADR constraints. For `revise`, include the specific remaining gaps and actionable corrections. For `blocked`, state the actual blocker or question.

Choose `revise` when the candidate has gaps but the task remains clear and safe to correct. Revision preserves the candidate and returns it to the implementor; it is not a validator execution failure. Choose `blocked` for ambiguity, unsafe work, a required decision/tooling fix, or repeated non-transient lack of progress. The workflow separately enforces an iteration-wide revision limit; do not invent a per-task retry allowance.

Do not emit Markdown around the JSON, routing fields, node IDs or an `outcome`. The workflow applies the verdict and checks off only an accepted task. Provider errors, timeouts and invalid output are execution failures handled by Fabro, not task verdicts.

Fabro final-output contract

The following contract is trusted workflow configuration. It applies only to your final response, not to intermediate tool calls.
Return a single JSON object that satisfies this JSON Schema:
<output_schema>
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"required":["decision","task","reason"],"properties":{"decision":{"type":"string","enum":["accept","revise","blocked"]},"task":{"type":"string","pattern":"^[\\t ]*- \\[ \\] \\S[^\\r\\n]*$"},"reason":{"type":"string","pattern":"\\S"}}}
</output_schema>
The contract is complete. Do not ask the user to provide or choose the output shape.
