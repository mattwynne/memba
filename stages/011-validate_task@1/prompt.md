  - The home no longer renders a delivery glance on conversation rows.
  - The reply count includes both in-app replies and email replies.
  
  ## Open Business Decisions
  
  None known.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Add `Messaging.list_conversations_for_club/1`: a read-model query over
     `MessageProjection` that returns one entry per conversation (root message), each with
     `reply_count` and the latest replier (id/name), ordered by the root's `inserted_at`
     descending (secondary `message_id`). Group by `conversation_id`; the root is the row
     where `message_id == conversation_id`; replies are the rest.
  2. Update `MemberDashboardPresentation` to build its message rows from
     `list_conversations_for_club/1` instead of `list_messages_for_club/1`: subject,
     originator name + initials, reply count, latest-replier name, original send date.
     Drop the receipt-glance fields from the home row.
  3. Update `PageHTML.club` (`club.html.heex`) `#member-message-list` markup to the
     conversation row: originator avatar, subject, "Started by …", the reply-activity
     line, original send date. Remove the delivery glance markup.
  4. Keep the row link target unchanged (the conversation/message-detail route).
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  - Exact shape of the latest-replier lookup in the group-by (window function vs. a second
    query keyed by conversation). Either is acceptable; prefer one query if clean.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  The club home reflects **conversations**, not raw messages: members see how active a
  thread is at a glance and replies no longer clutter the list as fake new messages.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - The new `@todo-domain` read-model Cucumber scenarios in `club_message_replies.feature`
    go green (and the tag is removed) once implemented.
  - An ExUnit test for `MemberDashboardPresentation` covering: grouping, reply count,
    latest replier, ordering, and the absence of receipt-glance fields.
  - A `bin/dev gallery-walk` screenshot confirming the "Saturday ridge walk" conversation
    renders as a single row with its reply count on the member club home.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Removing the home delivery glance means managers check send health on the conversation
    page; acceptable and consistent with demoting delivery.
  - Buckets B (conversation page), C (emails), D (stop-following) remain in the gaps
    problem note for future iterations.
  - New/unread-activity emphasis is captured as its own problem note (needs per-member read
    state) and is intentionally not part of this slice.

Validate the just-completed iteration task for `docs/iterations/043-conversations-overview-grouping/plan.md`.

You have tool access. Use it. Decide from live repository state, not from summarized context alone. Read `/tmp/fabro-pre-validate-snapshot.md`, run `git status --short`, inspect `git diff`, inspect recent commits with `git log --oneline -5`, and read changed files as needed.

Important workflow contract: Fabro checkpoints after every node. Therefore, at validation time the just-completed task may appear either as uncommitted working-tree changes or as the latest/recent Fabro checkpoint commit on HEAD. A clean working tree is not, by itself, a failure.

Validate the task evidence, not a single storage mechanism. Prefer live working-tree diff/status when present; when the working tree is clean, corroborate the task using recent checkpoint commits and their diffs. Do not infer infrastructure faults unless live repository evidence proves the expected files or diffs are genuinely absent.

Do not rely on a selected-task temp file. Instead inspect the plan, `todo.md`, relevant ADRs, current repository diff/status, recent checkpoint diffs, test evidence, and the preceding implementation summary. Identify the completed task by the `todo.md` diff from the working tree or latest/recent checkpoint: exactly one ordinary task line should have changed from unchecked (`- [ ]`) to checked (`- [x]`) unless there is a clear plan-preserving split/reorder rationale.

## Validate

Accept the task only if all are true:

- The checked-off task is the first unchecked task that existed when the implementor started, or a clearly justified first slice after a plan-preserving split.
- The same task that was implemented has been checked off in `todo.md`.
- The task has concrete code/config/test/documentation evidence as appropriate; a todo-only change is invalid.
- The work stays within the approved plan and preserves plan-required scope.
- Any todo changes split/add/reorder only to satisfy the plan; no plan-required work was deleted, weakened, or silently deferred.
- Relevant automated tests were added/updated and focused tests were run, or a justified blocker was reported.
- Accepted ADR constraints relevant to this task are respected.
- Acceptance feature files (`*.feature`, including under `acceptance-tests/`) were not edited unless the plan has a `## Allowed acceptance feature changes` section naming the exact file and allowed kind of change; any permitted edit stays within that explicit permission and preserves/validates the coverage promised by the plan.
- The task is small enough to stand independently with a useful Fabro checkpoint evidence trail.

If validation fails but the task is still clear and safe to attempt again, request a clean retry from the last successful checkpoint. Do not ask for in-place repair. Only request human input when the task, plan, or repository state is ambiguous, unsafe, repeatedly failing for the same non-transient reason, or blocked by a decision/tooling issue that another clean attempt is unlikely to solve.

## Output format

Return concise Markdown with:

### Decision
One of: **VALID**, **RETRY**, or **HUMAN_INPUT**

### Evidence
- Completed todo/check-off evidence found.
- Implementation artifacts found.
- Tests run/results found.
- ADR/plan conformance notes.

### Retry brief
Only if RETRY: exact reason the attempt was rejected from live repository evidence, plus concise guidance for the next clean attempt. The workflow will snapshot the failed working tree before resetting and trying again.

### Human input
Only if HUMAN_INPUT: exact blocker/question.

End your response with exactly one JSON object for Fabro routing, not in a code fence:

- Valid:
  {"context_updates":{"task_valid":true,"task_retry_available":false}}
- Clean retry needed:
  {"context_updates":{"task_valid":false,"task_retry_available":true}}
- Human input required:
  {"context_updates":{"task_valid":false,"task_retry_available":false}}
