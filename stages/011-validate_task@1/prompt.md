  - Member pages remain responsive at desktop and mobile (verified via gallery-walk).
  - `dev check` passes.
  
  ## Open Business Decisions
  
  None outstanding.
  
  Confirmed decisions:
  
  - Remove the white-label plumbing now; restart white-labelling as a separate initiative later.
  - Delivery-colour change applies to member surfaces only.
  - Adopt the shared button/avatar/status_badge components.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Inventory the member templates/layout and their bespoke markup: `web/lib/memba_web/controllers/page_html/club.html.heex`, `message.html.heex`, the compose template, the public club page template, and `Layouts.club_site` (`--club-site-*`).
  2. Remove the `--club-site-*` layer: replace its variables/classes with sage tokens + daisyUI classes; simplify or retire the white-label parts of `Layouts.club_site` while keeping the member page chrome (header/footer) working in sage.
  3. Replace member-page buttons with `<.button>`, mapping each to the right variant/size; preserve `href`/`navigate`/form behaviour.
  4. Replace member initials avatars with `<.avatar>`, including the club-home stack and "+N".
  5. Re-map the member delivery-status colours to sage/warning/error in the member presentation/helper used by the receipt mini-bars and the message-read breakdown card (e.g. the member `status_bg_class`/`MemberEmailDeliveryPresentation` path), without touching the staff delivery path. Apply `status_badge` where a pill is the right element.
  6. Sweep the four member pages for any remaining hardcoded hex; replace with tokens/daisyUI classes.
  7. Add/update component, LiveView, and template tests for button/avatar/status usage and the member delivery-colour mapping; keep existing member tests green.
  8. Run `./bin/dev gallery-walk` and review the member screenshots (desktop + mobile) for visual correctness.
  9. Run `dev check`.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  - Exact extent to which `Layouts.club_site` can be simplified versus replaced — keep member-page header/footer chrome working; don't break the public club page layout.
  - Whether the member delivery-colour mapping lives in a member-specific helper or the shared presentation module — choose the path that changes member surfaces only and leaves staff untouched.
  
  These are implementation details and should not need product decisions.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  The member experience — club home, reading and composing club messages, and the public club page — looks and feels like one coherent Memba product built from the shared design system, with on-brand delivery status, replacing the bespoke, off-palette, white-label-scaffolded member UI.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Component/LiveView/template tests for button, avatar, and status usage on member pages.
  - Tests for the member delivery-status colour mapping (Delivered = sage, etc.) with staff path asserted unchanged.
  - `./bin/dev gallery-walk` visual review of all four member pages at desktop + mobile.
  - Confirm existing member messaging/delivery acceptance scenarios remain green.
  - Full `dev check` before delivery is complete.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Removing `--club-site-*` could ripple into the public club page and the club chrome (header/footer). Keep the chrome working; if removal proves larger than polish, narrow to the member app pages and record the public club page as a follow-up.
  - The delivery-status colour mapping may currently be shared between member and staff surfaces. If so, fork a member-specific mapping (or parameterise) so staff colours stay unchanged, and note any shared-helper cleanup as a follow-up.
  - White-labelling is now removed, not parked behind a flag — restarting it later is a deliberate separate initiative; ensure removal is clean rather than half-disabled.
  - Keep the slice presentational; if a behaviour/copy issue is non-trivial, file a problem note instead of widening scope.

Validate the just-completed iteration task for `docs/iterations/034-member-page-design-system-alignment/plan.md`.

You have tool access. Use it. Decide from live repository state, not from summarized context alone. Read `/tmp/fabro-pre-validate-snapshot.md`, run `git status --short`, inspect `git diff`, inspect recent commits with `git log --oneline -5`, and read changed files as needed.

Important workflow contract: Fabro checkpoints after every node. Therefore, at validation time the just-completed task may appear either as uncommitted working-tree changes or as the latest/recent Fabro checkpoint commit on HEAD. A clean working tree is not, by itself, a failure.

Validate the task evidence, not a single storage mechanism. Prefer live working-tree diff/status when present; when the working tree is clean, corroborate the task using recent checkpoint commits and their diffs. Do not infer infrastructure faults unless live repository evidence proves the expected files or diffs are genuinely absent.

Do not rely on a selected-task temp file. Instead inspect the plan, `todo.md`, relevant ADRs, current repository diff/status, recent checkpoint diffs, test evidence, and the preceding implementation summary. Identify the completed task by the `todo.md` diff from the working tree or latest/recent checkpoint: exactly one ordinary task line should have changed from unchecked (`- [ ]`) to checked (`- [x]`) unless there is a clear plan-preserving split/reorder rationale.

## Validate

Accept the task only if all are true:

- The checked-off task is the first unchecked task that existed when the implementor started, or a clearly justified first slice after a plan-preserving split.
- The same task that was implemented has been checked off in `todo.md`.
- The task has concrete code/config/test/documentation evidence as appropriate; a todo-only change is invalid.
- The work stays within the approved plan and preserves plan-required scope.
- Any todo changes split/add/reorder only to satisfy the plan; no plan-required work was deleted, weakened, or silently deferred.
- Relevant automated tests were added/updated and focused tests were run, or a justified blocker was reported.
- Accepted ADR constraints relevant to this task are respected.
- Acceptance feature files (`*.feature`, including under `acceptance-tests/`) were not edited unless the plan has a `## Allowed acceptance feature changes` section naming the exact file and allowed kind of change; any permitted edit stays within that explicit permission and preserves/validates the coverage promised by the plan.
- The task is small enough to stand independently with a useful Fabro checkpoint evidence trail.

If validation fails but the task is still clear and safe to attempt again, request a clean retry from the last successful checkpoint. Do not ask for in-place repair. Only request human input when the task, plan, or repository state is ambiguous, unsafe, repeatedly failing for the same non-transient reason, or blocked by a decision/tooling issue that another clean attempt is unlikely to solve.

## Output format

Return concise Markdown with:

### Decision
One of: **VALID**, **RETRY**, or **HUMAN_INPUT**

### Evidence
- Completed todo/check-off evidence found.
- Implementation artifacts found.
- Tests run/results found.
- ADR/plan conformance notes.

### Retry brief
Only if RETRY: exact reason the attempt was rejected from live repository evidence, plus concise guidance for the next clean attempt. The workflow will snapshot the failed working tree before resetting and trying again.

### Human input
Only if HUMAN_INPUT: exact blocker/question.

End your response with exactly one JSON object for Fabro routing, not in a code fence:

- Valid:
  {"context_updates":{"task_valid":true,"task_retry_available":false}}
- Clean retry needed:
  {"context_updates":{"task_valid":false,"task_retry_available":true}}
- Human input required:
  {"context_updates":{"task_valid":false,"task_retry_available":false}}
