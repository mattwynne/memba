  5. Implement caller-generated UUID aggregate identities per ADR 0011.
  6. Implement minimal Membership aggregates, commands, and events:
     - Club: create a club.
     - Person: create a person with name and email; person identity is club-independent.
     - Membership: add a person as an active member of a club. For this iteration, memberships are active from creation and cannot lapse, expire, or be revoked.
  7. Implement Membership projections/read models and a public Membership query API. Messaging must call this query API to resolve active club members; it must not depend directly on Membership Ecto schemas or projection tables.
  8. Implement the Messaging aggregate as one aggregate per message per ADR 0004.
  9. Implement `SendMessage` so the application service resolves recipients via Membership's query API and includes those resolved recipients in the command, per ADR 0005.
  10. Have the Message aggregate emit `MessageSent` plus one recipient delivery event per resolved recipient in the message stream.
  11. Implement the delivery status state machine inside the Message aggregate:
      - statuses: sent, delivered, delayed, bounced, spam complaint, opened;
      - member-facing mapping from ADR 0006;
      - opened semantics from ADR 0012;
      - invalid transitions rejected;
      - duplicate equivalent status reports idempotent.
  12. Define a fake/stub delivery provider port used by the message-sending service/tests. For this iteration, fake provider success means Memba has handed the delivery to the provider.
  13. Implement Messaging projections/read queries for messages, recipient deliveries, member-facing receipts, and operator deliverability details using `commanded_ecto_projections`.
  14. Configure Elixir Cucumber to read shared feature files from `acceptance-tests/features/**/*.feature` and execute domain step definitions from the Phoenix app test suite, per ADR 0010.
  15. Add domain-level Cucumber step definitions for the shared member-message and operator-deliverability scenarios using fake/stub ports.
  16. Keep the existing cucumber-js/Playwright setup available for future whole-app execution of the same scenarios, but do not implement the Phoenix UI layer in this iteration.
  17. Add lower-level ExUnit tests where useful for EventStore setup, aggregate rules, projector behaviour, status-transition idempotency, and fake provider interactions.
  18. Run `devenv shell mix precommit` and fix any issues.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  - Exact compatible package versions should be chosen during implementation for `commanded_eventstore_adapter`, `eventstore`, `commanded_ecto_projections`, and the GitHub Cucumber dependency.
  - Exact folder structure for Elixir Cucumber support code should be chosen during implementation, while preserving ADR 0010's shared feature-file paths.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  After this iteration, Memba will have event-sourced Membership and Messaging domain skeletons. It will be able to model a member sending a message to all active members of their club, create per-recipient delivery state, and project both simple member-facing receipt statuses and detailed operator deliverability information using a fake provider.
  
  This creates the product-shaped foundation for the next iteration: live Postmark sending, provider webhooks, tracking pixels, and a real deliverability demo with test inboxes.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Use the shared Cucumber feature files as the domain model specification for this iteration.
  - Run the shared scenarios against the Elixir domain model with `huddlz-hq/cucumber` and fake/stub ports.
  - Keep scenarios abstract from infrastructure so they can later run through cucumber-js/Playwright against the whole Phoenix app.
  - Add ExUnit tests for lower-level technical details that are not appropriate in Gherkin.
  - Run `devenv shell mix precommit` before considering implementation complete.
  - No live provider/manual inbox demo is required in this iteration; that belongs to the follow-up Postmark deliverability iteration.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - EventStore setup may reveal package-version or database lifecycle issues; if so, resolve them before adding live delivery-provider integration.
  - The shared-scenario/two-runner approach is new to this project and may need folder/test-runner refinement.
  - The minimal membership model may need to evolve soon to include active/lapsed membership state, households, renewals, privacy preferences, and unsubscribe/compliance rules.
  - Future notification channels may require changing delivery-channel fields and provider abstractions; ADR 0005 says to keep the shape channel-neutral where practical.
  - The next slice should integrate Postmark end to end: real sending, webhooks, tracking pixel, and a manual demo script using Gmail, Outlook/Hotmail, and other test inboxes.

You are independently reviewing an iteration plan before implementation.

Use the plan text from the preceding `Read Iteration Plan` stage. Do not assume any missing details. Be strict, practical, and specific.

Review the plan against these readiness questions:

1. Goal clarity
   - Is the goal clearly articulated?
   - Does it state the user/business outcome, not just tasks?
   - Is the intended beneficiary or actor clear?

2. Scope focus
   - Is the scope focused on one coherent outcome?
   - Could the iteration be any smaller while still useful?
   - Are non-goals and boundaries clear?

3. Acceptance criteria and business decisions
   - Are acceptance criteria concrete, clear, complete, and objectively testable?
   - Do they cover happy paths, important edge cases, permissions, error states, and data/state changes where relevant?
   - Are any business, product, policy, copy, workflow, or domain decisions still unresolved?

4. Implementation plan and technical decisions
   - Are implementation steps clear, ordered, and specific?
   - Are likely files, modules, migrations, tests, interfaces, and integration points named where useful?
   - Are data model, API, UI, workflow, integration, and background-job changes clear enough?
   - Are any technical decisions still unresolved?

5. Expected capability and validation
   - What should we be able to do after this iteration that we cannot do now?
   - How will we prove success?
   - Is there a clear stop condition?
