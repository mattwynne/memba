  ```
  (51 lines omitted)
  - Delayed, bounced, and spam complaint rows preserve the provider/channel reason text.
  - Opened deliveries are visible as `opened` after a delivered email is opened.
  - Delivered/opened rows do not show stale problem reasons.
  - `operator_email_deliverability.feature` uses deliveries-overview language and passes through the browser acceptance harness without `@todo-web` deferral.
  - `homepage.feature` and `member_message_deliverability.feature` continue to pass through the browser acceptance harness.
  - The Elixir/domain acceptance path used by `dev check` still runs the shared scenarios.
  - `dev check` passes.
  
  ## Open Business Decisions
  
  None known.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Update the operator feature language around the rule "Operators monitor detailed delivery records across messages", keeping scenarios BRIEF and focused on cross-message visibility, reason preservation, and opened status.
  2. Write failing PhoenixTest coverage for `/deliveries`, including records from more than one message and problem reason text.
  3. Reshape the public Messaging operator-deliverability query toward a deliveries-overview API, for example an options-shaped list function. Preserve any existing message-scoped needs through options or a compatibility wrapper only if still required by current code.
  4. Add the `/deliveries` LiveView route under the browser pipeline.
  5. Build the deliveries LiveView as a simple read-only table with stable accessible labels or IDs for browser acceptance.
  6. Update browser Cucumber step definitions for `operator_email_deliverability.feature` so operator assertions inspect `/deliveries`.
  7. Remove `@todo-web` tags from operator scenarios once they are browser-backed.
  8. Verify browser Cucumber still defaults to excluding `@todo-web`, while now including the operator scenarios because they are no longer tagged.
  9. Run the browser acceptance suite and `dev check`, fixing any issues.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  None known. The intended technical shape is:
  
  - `/deliveries` is the operator overview route for delivery records across messages.
  - The query API is deliveries-overview oriented and options-shaped for later filtering/pagination.
  - This iteration may return an unpaginated list if that is the smallest working slice, but should order deterministically, preferably newest or most recently updated first.
  - Pagination/infinite scroll is explicitly deferred, not half-implemented.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Operators can inspect a single browser page showing detailed delivery records across messages, including problem reasons, instead of relying only on domain-level tests or message-scoped read models.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `npm test` from `acceptance-tests/` and confirm operator deliverability scenarios now run and pass through the browser acceptance harness.
  - Run PhoenixTest-based LiveView tests for the deliveries page/table.
  - Run the Elixir/domain acceptance path used by `dev check` and confirm it still runs the shared scenarios.
  - Run `dev check` and fix any failures.
  - Manual demo: start the Phoenix app, create a club with members, send at least two messages, POST Postmark-style delayed/bounced/spam/opened events, visit `/deliveries`, and see all delivery records in one table with statuses and reason text.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - The unfiltered table is intentionally minimal; filtering, search, pagination, infinite scroll, and exports should be planned as later slices once the overview shape proves useful.
  - The existing projection may not contain message title/subject in the most convenient form for an all-deliveries view; keep any projection/query changes narrow and backward-compatible with existing domain behaviour.
  - Authentication and operator permissions remain deferred and must be addressed before exposing this surface in a real multi-user setting.

You are independently reviewing an iteration plan before implementation.

Use the plan text from the preceding `Read Iteration Plan` stage. Do not assume any missing details. Be strict, practical, and specific.

Review the plan against these readiness questions:

1. Goal clarity
   - Is the goal clearly articulated?
   - Does it state the user/business outcome, not just tasks?
   - Is the intended beneficiary or actor clear?

2. Scope focus
   - Is the scope focused on one coherent outcome?
   - Could the iteration be any smaller while still useful?
   - Are non-goals and boundaries clear?

3. Acceptance criteria and business decisions
   - Are acceptance criteria concrete, clear, complete, and objectively testable?
   - Do they cover happy paths, important edge cases, permissions, error states, and data/state changes where relevant?
   - Are any business, product, policy, copy, workflow, or domain decisions still unresolved?

4. Implementation plan and technical decisions
   - Are implementation steps clear, ordered, and specific?
   - Are likely files, modules, migrations, tests, interfaces, and integration points named where useful?
   - Are data model, API, UI, workflow, integration, and background-job changes clear enough?
   - Are any technical decisions still unresolved?

5. Expected capability and validation
   - What should we be able to do after this iteration that we cannot do now?
   - How will we prove success?
   - Is there a clear stop condition?
