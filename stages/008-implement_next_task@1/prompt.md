  3. Update member step definitions so:
     - `When Alice sends...` uses Alice's member session and the club-home send flow;
     - `When Alice/Bob views...` uses that member's session and `GET /messages/:message_id?club_id=<club_id>`;
     - receipt assertions read member-facing recipient rows, labels, and icons.
  4. Build/refine member club home at `GET /?club_id=<club_id>`:
     - recent messages link to member message detail;
     - active members summary/list;
     - inline compose form/action based on the wireframe's compose design.
  5. Add member message detail at `GET /messages/:message_id?club_id=<club_id>`:
     - authorize active membership for the `club_id` query param;
     - ensure the message belongs to that club;
     - apply existing failure conventions:
       - unauthenticated access redirects to `/auth` and preserves return path;
       - signed-in non-members/inactive members for `club_id` get forbidden;
       - message/club mismatch responds not found;
       - failure paths do not expose message content or operator-only diagnostics;
     - show subject, body, sender, and addressed members with grouped receipt statuses and stable recipient rows.
  6. Add a presentation mapping for member receipt labels and Heroicons without changing internal projection values.
  7. Keep staff/admin diagnostics unchanged on `/admin/messages/:message_id` and `/admin/deliveries`.
  8. Add focused tests for member route authorization, message-club ownership checks, status label/icon mapping, and no operator-only fields on member pages.
  9. Remove `@wip` from `member_message_deliverability.feature` when browser scenarios pass.
  10. Run `dev check`.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  None known. Route shape, compose placement, receipt display, and icon source are decided in Scope and Implementation Plan.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Memba can prove member-message behaviour through the actual member experience. Members can send a club message and inspect member-friendly receipts for everyone addressed, while detailed deliverability diagnostics remain staff/operator-only.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `dev check`.
  - Browser Cucumber passes with `member_message_deliverability.feature` untagged.
  - Targeted browser evidence proves:
    - setup may use staff/admin routes;
    - Alice sends from an authenticated member session;
    - Alice/Bob view receipt statuses from authenticated member sessions;
    - member assertions do not navigate to `/admin/*`.
  - Phoenix tests cover member route authorization, message-club ownership, status label/icon mapping, and member detail rendering without operator-only fields.
  - Manual demo script: `docs/iterations/011-member-facing-message-behaviour/manual-demo-script.md`.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Existing acceptance support is staff-harness-heavy; separating setup from member assertions may reveal coupling.
  - Query-string `club_id` remains temporary until custom domains exist.
  - The member-facing receipt policy may later need role controls if clubs consider receipts sensitive.
  - The sender-included rule is provisional.
  - The design reference is richer than this slice; avoid unrelated features.

Implement the next unchecked iteration task from `todo.md`.

Plan path: `docs/iterations/011-member-facing-message-behaviour/plan.md`.
Todo path is derived from the plan path by replacing `/plan.md` with `/todo.md`.

## Ownership rules

- Read the plan and `todo.md` before editing.
- Pick the first unchecked Markdown task line in `todo.md` (`- [ ] ...`). That task is yours from selection through check-off.
- Treat earlier checked todo lines as durable completed work. Do not redo them.
- Inspect recent Fabro checkpoint commits with `git log --oneline --decorate -20` and use their subjects/bodies/diffs as context for what previous runs already completed.
- Inspect `git status --short` before editing. The resume gate should normally guarantee a clean tree; if uncommitted changes are present, stop for human input unless they are clearly the selected task's in-progress work and you can safely continue it to completion without overwriting it.
- Never silently overwrite, discard, or duplicate uncommitted work for an unchecked task.
- Implement exactly the selected task only. Do not opportunistically implement later tasks unless the selected task cannot be completed without splitting/reordering the todo list first.
- When the implementation and focused validation are complete, check off the same task line you implemented by changing that one line from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`.
- Do not check off any other ordinary todo line.
- Do not commit manually. Fabro will checkpoint your changes automatically after this node; independent validation will inspect that checkpoint evidence.


## Local reference docs

- Prefer local project documentation over network lookups. Do not `curl` upstream docs unless the local docs are missing or clearly insufficient.
- Start with `docs/tools/README.md` for library documentation signposts. Relevant local docs include:
  - `docs/tools/commanded/README.md` for Commanded.
  - `docs/tools/commanded-eventstore-adapter/README.md` for the EventStore adapter.
  - `docs/tools/eventstore/README.md` for EventStore.
  - `docs/tools/commanded-ecto-projections/README.md` for projections.
  - `docs/tools/cucumber/README.md` for Elixir Cucumber.
  - `docs/tools/ecto/README.md` and `docs/tools/ecto-sql/README.md` for Ecto.
  - `docs/tools/phoenix/README.md` and related Phoenix docs for web framework work.
- If you need examples, search the local `web/deps/` source tree and `docs/tools/` before using the network.

## Binding rules

- `plan.md` remains the source of truth. `todo.md` is derived execution state.
- You may split the selected task into smaller unchecked tasks, add required technical subtasks, or reorder pending tasks only to satisfy the approved plan.
- If the selected task is too large, split it in `todo.md`, leave the parent/current task unchecked or replace it with smaller unchecked tasks, then implement and check off only the first newly available slice.
- You may not delete, weaken, or silently defer plan-required work.
- Before editing, read every ADR explicitly referenced by the plan and inspect nearby/current ADRs under `docs/adr/` when relevant.
- Treat accepted ADRs as binding architecture constraints.
- Use test-driven development for behaviour changes.
- Add or update automated tests proving the selected task's behaviour/configuration.
- Run focused validation appropriate to the selected task and capture the commands/results in your response.
- Acceptance feature files (`*.feature`, including files under `acceptance-tests/`) are locked unless the plan has a `## Allowed acceptance feature changes` section naming the exact file and allowed kind of change. If the plan permits a feature edit, make only that explicit edit and preserve/validate the coverage promised by the plan. If a feature file appears wrong, stale, or insufficient without explicit permission, stop and report the issue.
- Add acceptance step definitions only where the plan explicitly requires executable plumbing for shared feature files.
- Use Req for HTTP requests; do not introduce HTTPoison, Tesla, or `:httpc`.
- Follow relevant project guidance for Phoenix, LiveView, HEEx, Tailwind, Ecto, Elixir, Mix, and tests.
- If you hit a real blocker, stop and report it clearly without checking off the task.

When finished, summarize:

1. Selected todo line and task text.
2. Code/config/test/doc changes made for this task only.
3. Focused validation commands run and results.
4. The exact todo check-off you made.
5. Any todo splits/additions/reordering and why they still satisfy the plan.
6. ADR conformance evidence for this task.
