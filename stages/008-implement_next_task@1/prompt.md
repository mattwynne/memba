  - Provider open webhook events should be rejected as unsupported, not silently accepted.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Inspect current opened references in `web/lib`, `web/test`, `acceptance-tests/features`, active docs, and Postmark delivery code. Exclude old `docs/iterations/**` design/prototype artifacts from cleanup unless they are active validation inputs.
  2. Update shared acceptance feature expectations to remove opened receipts.
  3. Remove or deprecate the Messaging opened-report command/API/event path from current behaviour:
     - delete or stop routing `ReportEmailDeliveryOpened` command handling;
     - delete or stop emitting `EmailDeliveryOpened` for current command execution;
     - remove the delivered-to-opened transition from the aggregate;
     - ensure current public APIs and tests use delivered/problem statuses only.
  4. Update projections/read models and loaders so current status lists, summaries, and grouping functions do not include opened.
  5. Update Postmark outbound delivery so it does not set `track_opens: true` or any equivalent open-tracking option.
  6. Update Postmark webhook handling so open events are treated as unsupported and do not mutate delivery status.
  7. Update member LiveViews/presentation modules/tests to remove opened receipt segments, groups, toggles, counts, data attributes, and copy.
  8. Update Memba staff delivery views/tests to remove opened status expectations while preserving delivered/problem visibility.
  9. Update active operational/current-app documentation, especially Postmark email docs, to remove open-tracking instructions or claims.
  10. Run targeted tests while changing each layer, then run `dev check` and fix regressions.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  None known.
  
  Implementation notes:
  
  - If deleting old opened event modules would break event deserialization for local historic data, prefer keeping a compatibility shim that is not emitted by current code and is not exposed as current model behaviour. Do not add a data migration/backfill unless implementation discovers the app cannot boot or replay without one.
  - Keep webhook rejection consistent with the existing unsupported-event response style.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Memba can send and monitor member email delivery without pixel-based open tracking. The product vocabulary is simpler and avoids implying that Memba observes whether a recipient read a message.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run or update the shared acceptance harness so:
    - member deliverability scenarios pass with Sending, Delivered, and Delivery problem only;
    - staff deliverability scenarios pass without any opened scenario.
  - Run Messaging domain tests covering delivered, delayed, bounced, and spam complaint reports.
  - Run Postmark provider tests proving open tracking is not enabled.
  - Run Postmark webhook/controller tests proving open events are unsupported and do not alter delivery status.
  - Run member dashboard and member message LiveView tests proving opened groups/counts/copy are absent.
  - Run Memba staff delivery LiveView/tests proving opened status is absent while other statuses remain visible.
  - Run documentation/search checks such as `rg "opened|track_opens|open tracking" web/lib web/test acceptance-tests/features docs/email-delivery.md` and confirm remaining matches are either removed or explicitly historical/irrelevant.
  - Run `dev check`.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Removing old event modules entirely may be awkward if local event stores contain historic opened events. Keep compatibility internal if needed, but do not expose opened as current behaviour.
  - Third-party provider dashboards may still report opens independently if a stream was configured outside Memba. Document that Memba does not request or consume those signals.
  - Future engagement metrics, if ever wanted, should be planned as a separate product/privacy decision rather than reusing tracking pixels by accident.

## Current context

Implement the next unchecked iteration task from `todo.md`.

Plan path: `docs/iterations/017-remove-open-tracking/plan.md`.
Todo path is derived from the plan path by replacing `/plan.md` with `/todo.md`.

## Ownership rules

- Read the plan and `todo.md` before editing.
- Pick the first unchecked Markdown task line in `todo.md` (`- [ ] ...`). That task is yours from selection through check-off.
- Treat earlier checked todo lines as durable completed work. Do not redo them.
- Inspect recent Fabro checkpoint commits with `git log --oneline --decorate -20` and use their subjects/bodies/diffs as context for what previous runs already completed.
- Inspect `git status --short` before editing. The resume gate should normally guarantee a clean tree; if uncommitted changes are present, stop for human input unless they are clearly the selected task's in-progress work and you can safely continue it to completion without overwriting it.
- Never silently overwrite, discard, or duplicate uncommitted work for an unchecked task.
- Implement exactly the selected task only. Do not opportunistically implement later tasks unless the selected task cannot be completed without splitting/reordering the todo list first.
- When the implementation and focused validation are complete, check off the same task line you implemented by changing that one line from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`.
- Do not check off any other ordinary todo line.
- Do not commit manually. Fabro will checkpoint your changes automatically after this node; independent validation will inspect that checkpoint evidence.


## Local reference docs

- Prefer local project documentation over network lookups. Do not `curl` upstream docs unless the local docs are missing or clearly insufficient.
- Start with `docs/tools/README.md` for library documentation signposts. Relevant local docs include:
  - `docs/tools/commanded/README.md` for Commanded.
  - `docs/tools/commanded-eventstore-adapter/README.md` for the EventStore adapter.
  - `docs/tools/eventstore/README.md` for EventStore.
  - `docs/tools/commanded-ecto-projections/README.md` for projections.
  - `docs/tools/cucumber/README.md` for Elixir Cucumber.
  - `docs/tools/ecto/README.md` and `docs/tools/ecto-sql/README.md` for Ecto.
  - `docs/tools/phoenix/README.md` and related Phoenix docs for web framework work.
- If you need examples, search the local `web/deps/` source tree and `docs/tools/` before using the network.

## Binding rules

- `plan.md` remains the source of truth. `todo.md` is derived execution state.
- You may split the selected task into smaller unchecked tasks, add required technical subtasks, or reorder pending tasks only to satisfy the approved plan.
- If the selected task is too large, split it in `todo.md`, leave the parent/current task unchecked or replace it with smaller unchecked tasks, then implement and check off only the first newly available slice.
- You may not delete, weaken, or silently defer plan-required work.
- Before editing, read every ADR explicitly referenced by the plan and inspect nearby/current ADRs under `docs/adr/` when relevant.
- Treat accepted ADRs as binding architecture constraints.
- Use test-driven development for behaviour changes.
- Add or update automated tests proving the selected task's behaviour/configuration.
- Run focused validation appropriate to the selected task and capture the commands/results in your response.
- Acceptance feature files (`*.feature`, including files under `acceptance-tests/`) are locked unless the plan has a `## Allowed acceptance feature changes` section naming the exact file and allowed kind of change. If the plan permits a feature edit, make only that explicit edit and preserve/validate the coverage promised by the plan. If a feature file appears wrong, stale, or insufficient without explicit permission, stop and report the issue.
- Add acceptance step definitions only where the plan explicitly requires executable plumbing for shared feature files.
- Use Req for HTTP requests; do not introduce HTTPoison, Tesla, or `:httpc`.
- Follow relevant project guidance for Phoenix, LiveView, HEEx, Tailwind, Ecto, Elixir, Mix, and tests.
- If you hit a real blocker, stop and report it clearly without checking off the task.

When finished, summarize:

1. Selected todo line and task text.
2. Code/config/test/doc changes made for this task only.
3. Focused validation commands run and results.
4. The exact todo check-off you made.
5. Any todo splits/additions/reordering and why they still satisfy the plan.
6. ADR conformance evidence for this task.
