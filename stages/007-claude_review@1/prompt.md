  ## Designs
  
  - `design-system/templates/club-group-new.html`: name-only form, live domain validation/email preview, created states.
  - `design-system/templates/club-groups.html` and `design-system/explorations/custom-groups-prototype.html`: generic joined group and compose flows.
  
  Show New group only to admins. Live preview updates without losing focus/caret; untouched blank is neutral and an edited blank or duplicate has inline feedback. On creation, land on the ordinary Members list containing the creator. Omit Add member until 063; keep Conversations and its contextual New message action usable. No single-member promotional panel. All compose audience wording/count/address comes from the selected group, matching the deployed HEEx consolidation. Cloud sync is pending; reviewed local HTML is sufficient.
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  
  - Only an active admin in the destination club can create a custom group; client-supplied actor/club identities cannot widen authority.
  - Creation records name, stable slug and creator membership together, without a visible orphan group on partial completion.
  - Trim names; compare case-insensitively within the club, including Everyone/Admin names. Reuse nonblank display-name semantics, not an ASCII-only display-name restriction.
  - Generate an address-safe slug from the initial name, store it separately, and choose the first available numeric suffix from 2 if occupied. Existing system slugs are occupied too. The final slug stays within the existing 32-character limit, shortening the stem to fit a suffix. If no ASCII stem is produced, use `group` and normal suffixing. These technical defaults retain display-name freedom and the prototype's fallback.
  - Live preview and validation use the same rules as creation. Recheck at the authoritative boundary: concurrent same-name attempts cannot both succeed; distinct names with a slug collision get different stored addresses. A stale preview never reserves an address or overwrites another group.
  - Web messages target the selected group. Active club members may email a known group address to start a conversation without joining; this grants no read/follow/reply access. Existing follower-only reply rules remain.
  - Loss of club membership records the end of all custom memberships; rejoining Everyone does not reactivate them. Clear follows for those private-group conversations before they could resume after re-add. No custom group is silently archived or deleted.
  
  ## Open Business Decisions
  
  None known. The normalization/fallback/suffix details above are implementation defaults, not a new slug-editing feature. Existing sender-copy behaviour is deliberately preserved.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Add a thin authenticated Membership use case and actor-bearing custom-creation command, handled by the existing Club aggregate. Validate current active admin authority, same-club identity, group-name uniqueness and slug allocation inside that serialized boundary. Preserve trusted system/backfill command behaviour and historical events. Use a retry-stable group ID so retry does not silently become a second creation or change its address.
  2. Emit the existing group-created, slug-assigned and creator-added facts as one successful decision. Extend aggregate state/projection constraints only as necessary for normalized name uniqueness; keep projections as projections. Make new user-facing operations distinguish custom groups structurally, not by arbitrary display-name checks.
  3. Close the custom-membership departure gap now. Native `RemoveClubMember` currently emits only `ClubMemberRemoved`, and `SystemGroupMembership` removes only Everyone/Admin. Extend the Club-owned lifecycle to emit custom removals for the departing membership and keep legacy/replay handling safe. Arrange an idempotent Membership-to-Messaging policy for clearing affected follows, using public APIs and existing unfollow commands; do not put cross-context side effects in projectors. Ensure removal completion/rapid re-add cannot reactivate stale follows. Existing last-member/last-Admin invariants stay intact.
  4. Add the new-group LiveView/form using shared inputs and route helpers. Use server-side live validation/preview, rechecking at submit, with accessible field associations. Reuse normal pending/success and generic technical-error treatment. Extend group queries/routing only where the existing generic paths need it.
  5. Prove custom-group email routing and conversation authorisation using existing public Membership/Messaging APIs. Keep departure/rejoin safe at action and email-recipient/provider-handoff boundaries; never send private content to someone whose access has ended. Preserve already-handed-off email semantics; do not add an error dashboard or email retry product.
  6. Implement the tagged scenarios and targeted Club concurrency, identity, replay, departure/rejoin, slug-length and LiveView typing tests. Run `dev check` on the exact delivery state.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  Use the existing `Membership.Slug` helper for base generation and validation without changing club-slug policy; a small custom-group allocator supplies fallback/suffixes. Use named commands/policies rather than growing anonymous orchestration in `membership.ex`. No new foundational architecture is needed. Final policy module names can follow existing project conventions; ordering, replay idempotency and privacy must be tested, not left implicit.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  An admin can make Board a real conversation audience with a permanent email identity, using existing group messaging immediately.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Parse tagged scenarios while planning; keep pending behaviour excluded in each runner.
  - Aggregate tests: concurrent names/slugs, protected system identities, actor authorization, atomic creator membership and replay parity.
  - LiveView/browser: type, clear, correct a duplicate, preserve caret, preview a collision, submit and compare the actual address.
  - Domain/browser: web/email group audience and no access gained from non-member email posting; preserve current replies/recipient regressions.
  - Lifecycle tests: club departure/rejoin never restores groups/follows, including rapid transitions and an already-open view.
  - Full `dev check` on the exact committed/staged delivery state.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  Do not broaden discovery APIs into participation APIs. Do not rely on a projection uniqueness preview as the final guarantee. Do not copy the prototype's client-side authorization as production security. The follow-clearing policy crosses contexts and must be replay-safe and ordered; its use for explicit group removal is extended in 064. Unrelated CQRS cleanup, sender-copy suppression and archive/rename work remain deferred.

You are independently reviewing the completed, plan-conforming implementation of the iteration plan at docs/iterations/062-create-custom-groups/plan.md.

Use the prior context: the plan text, collected implementation evidence, current working tree state, commit range from `7b7ee1b8594cecb7bbd0bee562fa08815d8aa5e0..HEAD`, and the successful dev check output. Be strict, practical, and specific. Do not edit files.

This workflow reviews an already-committed implementation after the implementation workflow has proved plan conformance. The review job is code polish plus smell radar: refactoring, maintainability, project conventions, ADR conformance, and surfacing judgement-worthy non-blocking smells. Do not emit shell-command/tool-call JSON; return the Markdown review report only.

Use the project pattern reference docs as review guidelines when the touched code involves domain modeling, Commanded, aggregates, projections, event streams, read models, or object responsibility boundaries:

- `docs/reference/domain-driven-design.md`
- `docs/reference/cqrs.md`
- `docs/reference/event-sourcing.md`
- `docs/reference/responsibility-driven-design.md`

Treat accepted ADRs as binding project decisions. Treat these reference docs as design-quality guidance for interpreting and applying those ADRs, not as permission to override an ADR or the iteration plan.

Automated tests are the behavioural feedback loop in this workflow. If you find a likely behavioural gap, missing acceptance criterion, or inadequate automated coverage despite green dev check, flag it as a blocking issue requiring a new implementation/test pass or human decision; do not disguise it as refactoring feedback. Do not ask for feature-file edits.

Review against these questions:

0. ADR conformance
   - Read every ADR cited by the plan and any nearby/current ADRs under `docs/adr/` that govern touched architecture.
   - Follow signposts in those ADRs to the reference docs above; use them to check whether domain/CQRS/event-sourcing/RDD implementation choices match the patterns Memba wants.
   - Does the implementation obey accepted ADR decisions and consequences as binding constraints?
   - Does it avoid replacing ADR-mandated infrastructure or architecture with simpler local substitutes, unless the plan explicitly deferred that decision?
   - Do tests and implementation evidence prove the ADR-relevant behaviour, wiring, or structure?
   - Reject if the implementation conflicts with accepted ADRs or omits a cited ADR's central decision without an explicit plan deferral or human decision.

1. Light plan-fidelity sanity check
   - Does the implementation appear consistent with the stated goal and capability, given the plan-conformance gate has already passed?
   - Did it avoid obvious out-of-scope work?
   - If you find a substantial plan gap, classify it as blocking and requiring human input or a new implementation pass.

2. Behaviour and automated coverage
   - Did dev check pass before review?
   - Are important happy paths, edge cases, permissions, error states, and data/state changes covered by automated tests where appropriate?
   - Were acceptance feature files left unchanged as domain acceptance criteria?

3. Technical quality / refactoring
   - Are Phoenix, LiveView, HEEx, Ecto, Tailwind, and Elixir conventions followed where relevant?
   - Are migrations, schemas, contexts, tests, routes, UI, background jobs, and integrations coherent?
   - Is the implementation maintainable, minimal, and well factored?

4. Code-health classification
   - Blocking: ADR violations, behavioural gaps, missing or unsafe coverage, repeated blockers, or anything needing product/architecture judgement before merge.
   - Bounded-safe: concrete, low-risk refactoring, maintainability, convention, or test-quality fixes an agent can apply without changing product behaviour or feature files.
   - Judgement-worthy non-blocking: design smells, coupling, duplication, naming, dependency, or architecture drift that might merit human judgement later but should not block this merge.
