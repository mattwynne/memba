      - default slug generation from names;
      - valid and invalid staff-entered slugs;
      - duplicate slug live feedback and server rejection;
      - database unique constraint;
      - projection contains slug;
      - lookup by slug;
      - public host routing and unknown-host 404;
      - existing club-id queries and member routes still work;
      - admin UI displays and edits slug.
  15. Run `dev check`.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  None known.
  
  Decisions made during planning:
  
  - Maximum slug length is 32 characters.
  - Public club subdomains use `slug.clubs.memba.io`, not `slug.memba.io`.
  - Actual production DNS setup is a prerequisite outside Fabro, not part of implementation delivery.
  - Staff-entered slugs must already be address-safe; the app should not silently kebab-case arbitrary staff input.
  - Duplicate slug feedback should be live in the client and enforced on the server/database.
  - Old slug-less `ClubCreated` event replay does not need compatibility support because there is no live production data yet.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Memba can identify a club by a stable public slug, staff can manage that slug safely, and public visitors can reach a club's public page at a human-readable subdomain such as `kmc.clubs.memba.io`.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `dev check`.
  - Run targeted Membership domain/projection tests for club creation, slug generation, slug validation, uniqueness, and slug lookup.
  - Run targeted migration/persistence tests verifying `membership_clubs.slug` is non-null and unique.
  - Run targeted Phoenix/LiveView tests verifying staff can see/edit slugs and receive live duplicate/invalid feedback.
  - Run targeted routing/controller/LiveView tests verifying:
    - `kmc.clubs.memba.io` renders Kootenay Mountaineering Club's public page;
    - `unknown.clubs.memba.io` returns 404;
    - existing `club_id` public/member links still work.
  - Confirm the new Cucumber feature file remains tagged `@wip` until implemented.
  - Manual production validation after deploy:
    - confirm wildcard DNS for `*.clubs.memba.io` resolves to the production app;
    - confirm `https://kmc.clubs.memba.io` shows KMC's public page;
    - confirm `https://unknown.clubs.memba.io` returns 404.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Host-based routing may interact with endpoint URL, allowed-host, proxy, or deployment configuration. Tests should cover host handling explicitly.
  - Slug rename/aliasing will matter once public subdomains or inbound email addresses are advertised, but it is intentionally out of scope here.
  - Future inbound email and hosted subdomains may require reserved slugs such as `www`, `app`, `admin`, `support`, `postmaster`, `abuse`, or `no-reply`; that reserved-word policy can be added before wider public use.
  - Production DNS propagation and TLS certificate coverage for `*.clubs.memba.io` must be verified outside Fabro.

  - [ ] 005 Update `Membership.create_club/2` and relevant forms to use the generated default slug while allowing staff override.
  - [ ] 006 Add a migration to add `slug` to `membership_clubs`, backfill existing rows deterministically, set non-null, and create a unique index.

  - [ ] 008 Do not support replay of old slug-less `ClubCreated` events. There is no live data yet; development/test event stores may be reset or backfilled as needed.
  - [ ] 009 Add `Membership.get_club_by_slug/1`, using normalized lookup input only where safe and returning `nil` for invalid/unknown values.
  - [ ] 010 Add a minimal staff/admin club edit page for name/slug editing or, if creation already exists, extend the creation/edit flow with slug controls.
  - [ ] 011 Implement live validity/availability feedback for staff slug editing, either in LiveView or via a small admin-only validation endpoint.
  - [ ] 012 Add host-based public club-page resolution for `*.clubs.memba.io`:
  - [ ] 013 Update seeds, fixtures, acceptance support, and tests to create clubs with slugs.
  - [ ] 014 Add tests for:

# Check iteration task list

Determine whether the current iteration todo list has any unchecked implementation tasks remaining.

Use the plan path input from the workflow:

- `docs/iterations/015-club-slugs/plan.md`

Rules:

- Derive the todo path by replacing the trailing `/plan.md` with `/todo.md`.
- Read the todo file.
- If the todo file is missing, empty, or unreadable, report that as a blocking problem and set `task_list_complete` to `false` and `task_list_needs_human` to `true`.
- If any line matches an unchecked Markdown task (`- [ ] ...`), set `task_list_complete` to `false` and `task_list_needs_human` to `false`.
- If no unchecked Markdown tasks remain, set `task_list_complete` to `true` and `task_list_needs_human` to `false`.
- Do not edit files.

Return a concise explanation and end with exactly one JSON context update object.

Examples:

Unchecked tasks remain:

```json
{"context_updates":{"task_list_complete":false,"task_list_needs_human":false}}
```

All tasks complete:

```json
{"context_updates":{"task_list_complete":true,"task_list_needs_human":false}}
```

Blocking problem:

```json
{"context_updates":{"task_list_complete":false,"task_list_needs_human":true}}
```
