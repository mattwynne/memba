     - complete invited-person profile and accept invitation for unknown/incomplete person.
  5. Ensure duplicate checks use normalized email:
     - active member in club blocks invitation;
     - pending invitation in club resends;
     - existing person not in club can be invited and reused at acceptance.
  6. Add an invitation email module with clear club context and a one-use invitation link.
  7. Add the Staff club-scoped invite route and form. Exact route name is implementation detail, but it should sit under `/admin/clubs/:club_id/...` and not replace the existing person edit route.
  8. Decommission direct Staff club-member creation from name/email by hiding/removing that action or redirecting it to the invite route. Keep person edit behaviour where still needed for existing people.
  9. Add an invitation callback route that validates invitation tokens, signs in the invited email for the invitation journey, and routes to either profile completion or the invited club. Do not consume a pending unknown invitee's token on first open; consume it only when profile completion or existing-person acceptance succeeds.
  10. Generalize the current staff onboarding/profile completion enough that invited unknown members can enter their name before membership activation. For this slice, profile-completion state can live in the invitation/session journey; do not create an incomplete person before the name is submitted, and avoid overbuilding date-of-birth or configurable detail schemas.
  11. Preserve existing staff onboarding: new Memba staff with no person record still enter a name and continue to the Staff area.
  12. Add domain/application tests for pending invitation creation, duplicate active block, duplicate pending resend, existing-person acceptance, unknown-person profile completion, abandoned profile completion, and accepted-link reuse.
  13. Add browser/LiveView/controller tests for the Staff invite page, invitation email link, profile completion page, and final redirect to the club.
  14. Implement or update Cucumber step definitions only as needed to exercise `club_member_invitations.feature`.
  15. Remove or narrow `@todo-domain`/`@todo-ui` from `club_member_invitations.feature` once implemented.
  16. Run targeted tests for affected auth/membership/onboarding surfaces, then run `dev check`.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  - Exact invitation aggregate/stream shape and event names.
  - Exact URL and LiveView/controller split for the Staff invite page, invitation callback, and profile completion step.
  
  Resolved technical decisions for this slice:
  
  - Invitation tokens use separate invitation-token storage from ordinary sign-in tokens, because invitation links grant membership.
  - Unknown invited emails are represented as pending invitations only before acceptance/profile completion; do not create incomplete person records in this slice.
  - Profile-completion state for invited unknown people lives in the invitation/session journey until the invitee submits a valid name.
  - The invitation token is not consumed when an unknown invitee first opens the link. It remains usable while the invitation is pending, and is consumed only when profile completion succeeds and membership is created.
  - For existing complete people, following the link accepts the invitation, creates membership, consumes the token, signs them in, and lands them in the club.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Memba can invite a person to a club by email without trusting Staff-entered identity details. The invitee proves control of the email, supplies their own required name, and only then becomes an active ordinary club member.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Matt reviews `acceptance-tests/features/club_member_invitations.feature` for domain language before delivery is treated as final.
  - During implementation, add domain/application tests for invitation lifecycle and duplicate rules.
  - Add web tests for Staff invitation UI, email delivery, invitation callback, profile completion, and redirects.
  - Run the new Cucumber scenarios after removing or narrowing `@todo-domain`/`@todo-ui`.
  - Run existing authentication, request-account, person-email-address, and club membership administration tests to protect adjacent flows.
  - Run `dev check`.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - This does not yet let Membership Admins invite members, so the approved-club-owner problem remains unresolved for real club self-service.
  - Staff may still have global person/email-address management paths that can create unverified identity data. This slice should close the club-member creation bypass, but full email-verification policy remains larger.
  - Invitation links grant membership and currently have no expiry by decision; revisit expiry before broad production use if risk changes.
  - Pending invitation management is deferred: Staff cannot list, cancel, or manually resend from a management screen yet.
  - Future profile fields such as date of birth, emergency contact, or club-specific details need their own modelling and UX slices.

# Check iteration task list

Determine whether the current iteration todo list has any unchecked implementation tasks remaining.

Use the plan path input from the workflow:

- `docs/iterations/028-staff-member-invitations/plan.md`

Rules:

- Derive the todo path by replacing the trailing `/plan.md` with `/todo.md`.
- Read the todo file.
- If the todo file is missing, empty, or unreadable, report that as a blocking problem and set `task_list_complete` to `false` and `task_list_needs_human` to `true`.
- If any line matches an unchecked Markdown task (`- [ ] ...`), set `task_list_complete` to `false` and `task_list_needs_human` to `false`.
- If no unchecked Markdown tasks remain, set `task_list_complete` to `true` and `task_list_needs_human` to `false`.
- Do not edit files.

Return a concise explanation and end with exactly one JSON context update object.

Examples:

Unchecked tasks remain:

```json
{"context_updates":{"task_list_complete":false,"task_list_needs_human":false}}
```

All tasks complete:

```json
{"context_updates":{"task_list_complete":true,"task_list_needs_human":false}}
```

Blocking problem:

```json
{"context_updates":{"task_list_complete":false,"task_list_needs_human":true}}
```
