      - root public/member/non-member behaviour;
      - compose and message detail host-selected club behaviour;
      - unauthenticated private subdomain redirect and post-auth return;
      - signed-in non-member forbidden private URL;
      - legacy `club_id` fallback still works and remains protected;
      - main-host public and admin routes still work.
  13. Keep the new Cucumber feature tagged `@wip` until the delivery implementation adds matching step support and behaviour.
  14. Run `dev check`.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  None known.
  
  Decisions made during planning:
  
  - Use ADR 0019's local subdomain strategy: `lvh.me` for local/test wildcard loopback subdomains.
  - Keep `?club_id=<uuid>` as a temporary fallback, but stop generating it from normal member navigation.
  - Private member URLs on club subdomains should redirect signed-out visitors to sign-in and then return them to the same URL after magic-link auth.
  - Signed-in non-members should see forbidden/access denied on private member URLs.
  - Signed-in non-members at the club subdomain root should see the public club page.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Members can use a stable, human-readable club subdomain as their normal club-site address. The app can select the active club from the host for member dashboard, compose, and message detail pages, while still preserving public club pages and authentication/authorization boundaries.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `dev check`.
  - Run targeted web tests for club-site host detection, URL generation, root routing, private member routing, auth return-to, forbidden access, and legacy fallback routes.
  - Run targeted acceptance-test configuration checks proving `@wip` scenarios are excluded from the default browser Cucumber run.
  - Run browser acceptance support tests that verify local club URLs use `lvh.me` rather than `club_id` query strings.
  - Manual demo:
    1. Start the app locally.
    2. Sign in as a member of KMC.
    3. Confirm the home page links KMC to `kmc.lvh.me:<port>`.
    4. Open `kmc.lvh.me:<port>/` and confirm the KMC member dashboard appears.
    5. Open `kmc.lvh.me:<port>/messages/new` and send a message to KMC members.
    6. Open the message detail on `kmc.lvh.me:<port>/messages/:message_id`.
    7. Sign out, open the private message URL, sign in, and confirm the browser returns to that URL.
    8. Sign in as a member of another club and confirm the private KMC message URL is forbidden.
    9. Confirm `unknown.lvh.me:<port>/` returns 404.
    10. Confirm the old `/?club_id=<uuid>` fallback still works temporarily.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Absolute URL generation with scheme, host, and port can be subtle across Phoenix endpoint config, Playwright, reverse proxies, and production deployment. Keep helper tests explicit.
  - Auth return-to handling must preserve subdomain URLs without opening unsafe redirects to arbitrary external sites.
  - The temporary `club_id` fallback should be retired once all member navigation and external links have moved to subdomains.
  - Browser tests may need careful base URL and host handling because Playwright defaults to one base URL but club navigation crosses hosts.
  - Production TLS and wildcard DNS for `*.clubs.memba.io` remain deployment concerns outside this implementation slice.

  - [ ] 001 Inspect current routing, `PageController`, member dashboard LiveView, member message routes, compose route, auth return-to handling, and URL generation helpers.
  - [ ] 002 Add configuration for the club-site base domain and generated URL scheme/port where needed:
  - [ ] 003 Add a small URL/host helper or equivalent web module that:
  - [ ] 004 Update home-page “My clubs” link generation to use the helper and each club's slug.
  - [ ] 005 Update root club-subdomain handling so known club hosts choose between public page and member dashboard:
  - [ ] 006 Add host-selected member routes for compose and message detail, reusing existing member page modules where practical but passing `club_id` from slug lookup instead of from query parameters.
  - [ ] 007 Ensure private member routes require authentication and active membership for the host-selected club.
  - [ ] 008 Update auth redirect/return-to handling so private subdomain URLs preserve the original host and path through magic-link sign-in, while still avoiding unsafe open redirects.
  - [ ] 009 Keep old `?club_id=<uuid>` routes working as fallback routes and continue to protect them with active-membership checks.
  - [ ] 010 Update templates and verified routes so normal member navigation no longer emits `club_id` query strings.
  - [ ] 011 Update acceptance test support to build club URLs using the configured local base domain, defaulting to `lvh.me`, and to open host-based URLs in Playwright.
  - [ ] 012 Add or update tests for:
  - [ ] 013 Keep the new Cucumber feature tagged `@wip` until the delivery implementation adds matching step support and behaviour.
  - [ ] 014 Run `dev check`.

# Check iteration task list

Determine whether the current iteration todo list has any unchecked implementation tasks remaining.

Use the plan path input from the workflow:

- `docs/iterations/018-member-club-subdomains/plan.md`

Rules:

- Derive the todo path by replacing the trailing `/plan.md` with `/todo.md`.
- Read the todo file.
- If the todo file is missing, empty, or unreadable, report that as a blocking problem and set `task_list_complete` to `false` and `task_list_needs_human` to `true`.
- If any line matches an unchecked Markdown task (`- [ ] ...`), set `task_list_complete` to `false` and `task_list_needs_human` to `false`.
- If no unchecked Markdown tasks remain, set `task_list_complete` to `true` and `task_list_needs_human` to `false`.
- Do not edit files.

Return a concise explanation and end with exactly one JSON context update object.

Examples:

Unchecked tasks remain:

```json
{"context_updates":{"task_list_complete":false,"task_list_needs_human":false}}
```

All tasks complete:

```json
{"context_updates":{"task_list_complete":true,"task_list_needs_human":false}}
```

Blocking problem:

```json
{"context_updates":{"task_list_complete":false,"task_list_needs_human":true}}
```
