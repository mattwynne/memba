  - Delayed, bounced, and spam complaint rows preserve the provider/channel reason text.
  - Opened deliveries are visible as `opened` after a delivered email is opened.
  - Delivered/opened rows do not show stale problem reasons.
  - `operator_email_deliverability.feature` uses deliveries-overview language and passes through the browser acceptance harness without `@todo-web` deferral.
  - `homepage.feature` and `member_message_deliverability.feature` continue to pass through the browser acceptance harness.
  - The Elixir/domain acceptance path used by `dev check` still runs the shared scenarios.
  - `dev check` passes.
  
  ## Open Business Decisions
  
  None known.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Update the operator feature language around the rule "Operators monitor detailed delivery records across messages", keeping scenarios BRIEF and focused on cross-message visibility, reason preservation, and opened status.
  2. Write failing PhoenixTest coverage for `/deliveries`, including records from more than one message and problem reason text.
  3. Reshape the public Messaging operator-deliverability query toward a deliveries-overview API, for example an options-shaped list function. Preserve any existing message-scoped needs through options or a compatibility wrapper only if still required by current code.
  4. Add the `/deliveries` LiveView route under the browser pipeline.
  5. Build the deliveries LiveView as a simple read-only table with stable accessible labels or IDs for browser acceptance.
  6. Update browser Cucumber step definitions for `operator_email_deliverability.feature` so operator assertions inspect `/deliveries`.
  7. Remove `@todo-web` tags from operator scenarios once they are browser-backed.
  8. Verify browser Cucumber still defaults to excluding `@todo-web`, while now including the operator scenarios because they are no longer tagged.
  9. Run the browser acceptance suite and `dev check`, fixing any issues.
  
  ## Open Technical Decisions
  
  None known. The intended technical shape is:
  
  - `/deliveries` is the operator overview route for delivery records across messages.
  - The query API is deliveries-overview oriented and options-shaped for later filtering/pagination.
  - This iteration may return an unpaginated list if that is the smallest working slice, and should order by event timestamp descending (newest first).
  - Pagination/infinite scroll is explicitly deferred, not half-implemented.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Operators can inspect a single browser page showing detailed delivery records across messages, including problem reasons, instead of relying only on domain-level tests or message-scoped read models.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `npm test` from `acceptance-tests/` and confirm operator deliverability scenarios now run and pass through the browser acceptance harness.
  - Run PhoenixTest-based LiveView tests for the deliveries page/table.
  - Run the Elixir/domain acceptance path used by `dev check` and confirm it still runs the shared scenarios.
  - Run `dev check` and fix any failures.
  - Manual demo: start the Phoenix app, create a club with members, send at least two messages, POST Postmark-style delayed/bounced/spam/opened events, visit `/deliveries`, and see all delivery records in one table with statuses and reason text.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - The unfiltered table is intentionally minimal; filtering, search, pagination, infinite scroll, and exports should be planned as later slices once the overview shape proves useful.
  - The existing projection may not contain message title/subject in the most convenient form for an all-deliveries view; keep any projection/query changes narrow and backward-compatible with existing domain behaviour.
  - Authentication and operator permissions remain deferred and must be addressed before exposing this surface in a real multi-user setting.

# Check iteration task list

Determine whether the current iteration todo list has any unchecked implementation tasks remaining.

Use the plan path input from the workflow:

- `docs/iterations/007-deliveries-overview/plan.md`

Rules:

- Derive the todo path by replacing the trailing `/plan.md` with `/todo.md`.
- Read the todo file.
- If the todo file is missing, empty, or unreadable, report that as a blocking problem and set `task_list_complete` to `false` and `task_list_needs_human` to `true`.
- If any line matches an unchecked Markdown task (`- [ ] ...`), set `task_list_complete` to `false` and `task_list_needs_human` to `false`.
- If no unchecked Markdown tasks remain, set `task_list_complete` to `true` and `task_list_needs_human` to `false`.
- Do not edit files.

Return a concise explanation and end with exactly one JSON context update object.

Examples:

Unchecked tasks remain:

```json
{"context_updates":{"task_list_complete":false,"task_list_needs_human":false}}
```

All tasks complete:

```json
{"context_updates":{"task_list_complete":true,"task_list_needs_human":false}}
```

Blocking problem:

```json
{"context_updates":{"task_list_complete":false,"task_list_needs_human":true}}
```
