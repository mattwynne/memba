     - subject/body inputs using Phoenix form components;
     - “Send to all members” primary action and cancel/back action.
  7. Render success state based on `ComposeSuccess`, adding the required “Send another message” action.
  8. Render failure state based on `ComposeError`, adjusted to say nothing was sent and contact support; include Try again and Back to club home actions.
  9. Add or update LiveView/Phoenix tests for:
     - auth and selected-club requirements;
     - no sender dropdown;
     - sender derived from current member;
     - successful submit and success action links;
     - send failure state and support copy;
     - club home CTA replacing inline compose.
  10. Update acceptance step support only as needed for the new send-failure scenario and for existing normal-send steps to use the new compose flow without changing scenario wording.
      - Simulate send unavailability through test support rather than Gherkin wording. Prefer a test-only configuration seam around the existing message sending/delivery boundary (for example an application-env flag or fake-provider failure mode set by step support) so the feature can say only that sending is unavailable.
  11. Remove `@wip` from the new failure scenario once implemented and passing.
  12. Remove the legacy `POST /?club_id=<club_id>` send route and controller action in this slice once the LiveView submit path is covered. Do not keep a parallel member send endpoint unless a test reveals an existing non-UI caller that must be preserved.
  13. Run the targeted browser Cucumber feature and `dev check`.
  
  ## Technical Decisions
  
  - LiveView module: `MembaWeb.MemberMessageLive.New`.
  - Compose path: `GET /messages/new?club_id=<club_id>`; use Phoenix verified routes (`~p`) in implementation/tests.
  - Send-unavailability simulation: add/use a test-support seam around the sending boundary or fake provider configuration, configured by step support, without exposing infrastructure details in Gherkin.
  - Legacy inline send endpoint: remove the old `POST /?club_id=<club_id>` route/controller action once the LiveView submit path replaces it.
  
  ## New Capability
  
  Members have a focused, calmer compose experience with clear post-send choices. Messages are sent as the logged-in member, and failure is treated as an incident with support guidance rather than a confusing form validation problem.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Run `dev check`.
  - Run targeted LiveView/Phoenix tests for the compose LiveView and club-home CTA.
  - Run `acceptance-tests/features/member_message_deliverability.feature` through the browser runner.
  - Manual demo:
    - sign in as Alice;
    - open Kootenay Mountaineering Club;
    - click “Send club message”;
    - confirm compose screen has no sender dropdown and shows Alice as sender;
    - send “Trip planning night”;
    - confirm success state shows “See who got it”, “Send another message”, and “Back to home”;
    - follow “See who got it” to the message detail page;
    - return and use “Send another message” to start a fresh compose;
    - simulate send failure and confirm the message was not sent, support guidance appears, and Try again/Home actions are available.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - Existing browser helpers may assume the inline form exists; update helpers while keeping feature language business-focused.
  - Error simulation needs a clean test seam so the new Gherkin does not become infrastructure-specific.
  - Removing the sender dropdown changes a product affordance that existed accidentally; tests should make the new rule explicit.
  - Dashboard polish remains a future iteration.

You are independently reviewing the completed, plan-conforming implementation of the iteration plan at docs/iterations/013-member-compose-liveview-flow/plan.md.

Use the prior context: the plan text, collected implementation evidence, current working tree state, commit range from `c711ffddc40963a0cb752847b35b5442ec8d16a7..HEAD`, and the successful dev check output. Be strict, practical, and specific. Do not edit files.

This workflow reviews an already-committed implementation after the implementation workflow has proved plan conformance. The review job is code polish plus smell radar: refactoring, maintainability, project conventions, ADR conformance, and surfacing judgement-worthy non-blocking smells. Do not emit shell-command/tool-call JSON; return the Markdown review report only.

Automated tests are the behavioural feedback loop in this workflow. If you find a likely behavioural gap, missing acceptance criterion, or inadequate automated coverage despite green dev check, flag it as a blocking issue requiring a new implementation/test pass or human decision; do not disguise it as refactoring feedback. Do not ask for feature-file edits.

Review against these questions:

0. ADR conformance
   - Read every ADR cited by the plan and any nearby/current ADRs under `docs/adr/` that govern touched architecture.
   - Does the implementation obey accepted ADR decisions and consequences as binding constraints?
   - Does it avoid replacing ADR-mandated infrastructure or architecture with simpler local substitutes, unless the plan explicitly deferred that decision?
   - Do tests and implementation evidence prove the ADR-relevant behaviour, wiring, or structure?
   - Reject if the implementation conflicts with accepted ADRs or omits a cited ADR's central decision without an explicit plan deferral or human decision.

1. Light plan-fidelity sanity check
   - Does the implementation appear consistent with the stated goal and capability, given the plan-conformance gate has already passed?
   - Did it avoid obvious out-of-scope work?
   - If you find a substantial plan gap, classify it as blocking and requiring human input or a new implementation pass.

2. Behaviour and automated coverage
   - Did dev check pass before review?
   - Are important happy paths, edge cases, permissions, error states, and data/state changes covered by automated tests where appropriate?
   - Were acceptance feature files left unchanged as domain acceptance criteria?

3. Technical quality / refactoring
   - Are Phoenix, LiveView, HEEx, Ecto, Tailwind, and Elixir conventions followed where relevant?
   - Are migrations, schemas, contexts, tests, routes, UI, background jobs, and integrations coherent?
   - Is the implementation maintainable, minimal, and well factored?

4. Code-health classification
   - Blocking: ADR violations, behavioural gaps, missing or unsafe coverage, repeated blockers, or anything needing product/architecture judgement before merge.
   - Bounded-safe: concrete, low-risk refactoring, maintainability, convention, or test-quality fixes an agent can apply without changing product behaviour or feature files.
   - Judgement-worthy non-blocking: design smells, coupling, duplication, naming, dependency, or architecture drift that might merit human judgement later but should not block this merge.

Return a Markdown report with:

- Decision: ACCEPT or REJECT
- Confidence: High, Medium, or Low
- ADR conformance: PASS or FAIL
- ADR violations: numbered list with ADR number/file and implementation evidence
- Blocking issues: numbered list
- Bounded-safe fixes: numbered list
- Judgement-worthy non-blocking code-health findings: numbered list; for each include file(s), smell, and why it may need human judgement
- Suggested fixes: concrete changes if rejected or bounded-safe fixes exist
- Validation notes: tests/checks/manual checks relevant to the decision
