  - Cucumber step definitions for the scenario "A member sends a club
    message", including the assertions about who is and is not addressed and
    the per-recipient provider calls.
  - ExUnit coverage for the Message aggregate rules and the fake provider
    port.
  
  ### Out of scope
  
  - Delivery status transitions beyond `sent`.
  - Member-facing receipt status mapping (ADR 0006).
  - Operator deliverability view.
  - Open tracking and idempotency (ADR 0012).
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  
  - Sending a message to a club addresses exactly the active members of that
    club, and does not address members of other clubs.
  - One recipient delivery record exists per resolved recipient.
  - The fake provider port is called exactly once per recipient delivery.
  - The Cucumber scenario "A member sends a club message" passes.
  - ExUnit covers Message aggregate decisions, the application service's
    recipient resolution, and the fake provider port.
  - `devenv shell mix precommit` passes.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Add `Memba.Messaging.App` and `Memba.Messaging.Router`.
  2. Add the `Message` aggregate, `SendMessage` command, and `MessageSent` +
     per-recipient delivery events.
  3. Add the application service that resolves recipients via Membership and
     dispatches `SendMessage`.
  4. Define the fake delivery provider port and wire it into the message
     sending flow so it is called once per recipient.
  5. Add projections and queries for messages and recipient deliveries.
  6. Add Cucumber step definitions for "A member sends a club message".
  7. Run `devenv shell mix precommit` and fix any issues.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Cucumber scenario for sending a club message passes.
  - ExUnit covers aggregate rules, application service, and fake provider.
  - `devenv shell mix precommit` passes.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - The fake provider shape needs to be channel-neutral enough that ADR 0005
    remains satisfied when a real provider (likely Postmark) lands in a later
    iteration.
  - Iteration 004 adds the delivery status state machine, receipt mapping, and
    operator views.

You are independently reviewing the completed, plan-conforming implementation of the iteration plan at docs/iterations/003-messaging-skeleton/plan.md.

Use the prior context: the plan text, collected implementation evidence, current working tree state, commit range from `75c1d673cb9ee6c4247f605ac12fb32a62da884c..HEAD`, and the successful dev check output. Be strict, practical, and specific. Do not edit files.

This workflow reviews an already-committed implementation after the implementation workflow has proved plan conformance. The review job is code polish plus smell radar: refactoring, maintainability, project conventions, ADR conformance, and surfacing judgement-worthy non-blocking smells. Do not emit shell-command/tool-call JSON; return the Markdown review report only.

Automated tests are the behavioural feedback loop in this workflow. If you find a likely behavioural gap, missing acceptance criterion, or inadequate automated coverage despite green dev check, flag it as a blocking issue requiring a new implementation/test pass or human decision; do not disguise it as refactoring feedback. Do not ask for feature-file edits.

Review against these questions:

0. ADR conformance
   - Read every ADR cited by the plan and any nearby/current ADRs under `docs/adr/` that govern touched architecture.
   - Does the implementation obey accepted ADR decisions and consequences as binding constraints?
   - Does it avoid replacing ADR-mandated infrastructure or architecture with simpler local substitutes, unless the plan explicitly deferred that decision?
   - Do tests and implementation evidence prove the ADR-relevant behaviour, wiring, or structure?
   - Reject if the implementation conflicts with accepted ADRs or omits a cited ADR's central decision without an explicit plan deferral or human decision.

1. Light plan-fidelity sanity check
   - Does the implementation appear consistent with the stated goal and capability, given the plan-conformance gate has already passed?
   - Did it avoid obvious out-of-scope work?
   - If you find a substantial plan gap, classify it as blocking and requiring human input or a new implementation pass.

2. Behaviour and automated coverage
   - Did dev check pass before review?
   - Are important happy paths, edge cases, permissions, error states, and data/state changes covered by automated tests where appropriate?
   - Were acceptance feature files left unchanged as domain acceptance criteria?

3. Technical quality / refactoring
   - Are Phoenix, LiveView, HEEx, Ecto, Tailwind, and Elixir conventions followed where relevant?
   - Are migrations, schemas, contexts, tests, routes, UI, background jobs, and integrations coherent?
   - Is the implementation maintainable, minimal, and well factored?

4. Code-health classification
   - Blocking: ADR violations, behavioural gaps, missing or unsafe coverage, repeated blockers, or anything needing product/architecture judgement before merge.
   - Bounded-safe: concrete, low-risk refactoring, maintainability, convention, or test-quality fixes an agent can apply without changing product behaviour or feature files.
   - Judgement-worthy non-blocking: design smells, coupling, duplication, naming, dependency, or architecture drift that might merit human judgement later but should not block this merge.

Return a Markdown report with:

- Decision: ACCEPT or REJECT
- Confidence: High, Medium, or Low
- ADR conformance: PASS or FAIL
- ADR violations: numbered list with ADR number/file and implementation evidence
- Blocking issues: numbered list
- Bounded-safe fixes: numbered list
- Judgement-worthy non-blocking code-health findings: numbered list; for each include file(s), smell, and why it may need human judgement
- Suggested fixes: concrete changes if rejected or bounded-safe fixes exist
- Validation notes: tests/checks/manual checks relevant to the decision
