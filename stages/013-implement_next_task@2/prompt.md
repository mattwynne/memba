  - Cucumber step definitions for the scenario "A member sends a club
    message", including the assertions about who is and is not addressed and
    the per-recipient provider calls.
  - ExUnit coverage for the Message aggregate rules and the fake provider
    port.
  
  ### Out of scope
  
  - Delivery status transitions beyond `sent`.
  - Member-facing receipt status mapping (ADR 0006).
  - Operator deliverability view.
  - Open tracking and idempotency (ADR 0012).
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  
  - Sending a message to a club addresses exactly the active members of that
    club, and does not address members of other clubs.
  - One recipient delivery record exists per resolved recipient.
  - The fake provider port is called exactly once per recipient delivery.
  - The Cucumber scenario "A member sends a club message" passes.
  - ExUnit covers Message aggregate decisions, the application service's
    recipient resolution, and the fake provider port.
  - `devenv shell mix precommit` passes.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  1. Add `Memba.Messaging.App` and `Memba.Messaging.Router`.
  2. Add the `Message` aggregate, `SendMessage` command, and `MessageSent` +
     per-recipient delivery events.
  3. Add the application service that resolves recipients via Membership and
     dispatches `SendMessage`.
  4. Define the fake delivery provider port and wire it into the message
     sending flow so it is called once per recipient.
  5. Add projections and queries for messages and recipient deliveries.
  6. Add Cucumber step definitions for "A member sends a club message".
  7. Run `devenv shell mix precommit` and fix any issues.
  
  ## Validation Plan
  
  - Cucumber scenario for sending a club message passes.
  - ExUnit covers aggregate rules, application service, and fake provider.
  - `devenv shell mix precommit` passes.
  
  ## Risks / Follow-ups
  
  - The fake provider shape needs to be channel-neutral enough that ADR 0005
    remains satisfied when a real provider (likely Postmark) lands in a later
    iteration.
  - Iteration 004 adds the delivery status state machine, receipt mapping, and
    operator views.

  > 1. **Selected todo line**
  >    - `- [ ] 001 Add Memba.Messaging.App and Memba.Messaging.Router.`
  > 
  > 2. **Changes made**
  >    - Added `Memba.Messaging.App` as a separate Commanded application.
  >    - Added `Memba.Messaging.Router` as the Messaging command router.
  >    - Added `Memba.Messaging.EventStore` so the separate Messaging Commanded context can run without conflicting with the existing Membership EventStore process.
  >    - Wired `Memba.Messaging.App` into the Phoenix supervision tree.
  >    - Configured Messaging Commanded/EventStore settings for dev, test, and prod runtime.
  >    - Added focused tests for:
  >      - Messaging app supervision.
  >      - Messaging router registration.
  >      - Dispatch through the Messaging app/router.
  >      - Messaging Commanded/EventStore configuration.
  > 
  > 3. **Validation run**
  >    - `cd web && mix compile --warnings-as-errors` — passed.
  >    - `cd web && MIX_ENV=test mix compile --force --warnings-as-errors` — passed.
  >    - `PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH" dev check` — passed:
  >      - `58 tests, 0 failures`
  >      - command exited successfully.
  > 
  >    Notes:
  >    - An initial direct `mix test` attempt failed because Postgres was not running outside `dev`.
  >    - An initial `dev check` exposed an EventStore process-name conflict; this was fixed by giving Messaging its own EventStore module configured to the same dedicated EventStore schema.
  > 
  > 4. **Todo check-off made**
  >    - Changed exactly:
  >      - `- [ ] 001 Add Memba.Messaging.App and Memba.Messaging.Router.`
  >    - To:
  >      - `- [x] 001 Add Memba.Messaging.App and Memba.Messaging.Router.`
  > 
  > 5. **Todo splits/additions/reordering**
  >    - None.
  > 
  > 6. **ADR conformance evidence**
  >    - ADR 0007: Implemented a separate Messaging Commanded context with `Memba.Messaging.App` and `Memba.Messaging.Router`.
  >    - ADR 0008: Messaging uses the persistent Postgres EventStore path and the same dedicated `event_store` schema configuration pattern.
  >    - ADR 0004 / ADR 0005 / ADR 0011: No aggregate, command, recipient resolution, or identity behavior was added in this task, so those later requirements remain untouched for subsequent todo items.

Implement the next unchecked iteration task from `todo.md`.

Plan path: `docs/iterations/003-messaging-skeleton/plan.md`.
Todo path is derived from the plan path by replacing `/plan.md` with `/todo.md`.

## Ownership rules

- Read the plan and `todo.md` before editing.
- Pick the first unchecked Markdown task line in `todo.md` (`- [ ] ...`). That task is yours from selection through check-off.
- Treat earlier checked todo lines as durable completed work. Do not redo them.
- Inspect recent Fabro checkpoint commits with `git log --oneline --decorate -20` and use their subjects/bodies/diffs as context for what previous runs already completed.
- Inspect `git status --short` before editing. The resume gate should normally guarantee a clean tree; if uncommitted changes are present, stop for human input unless they are clearly the selected task's in-progress work and you can safely continue it to completion without overwriting it.
- Never silently overwrite, discard, or duplicate uncommitted work for an unchecked task.
- Implement exactly the selected task only. Do not opportunistically implement later tasks unless the selected task cannot be completed without splitting/reordering the todo list first.
- When the implementation and focused validation are complete, check off the same task line you implemented by changing that one line from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`.
- Do not check off any other ordinary todo line.
- Do not commit manually. Fabro will checkpoint your changes automatically after this node; independent validation will inspect that checkpoint evidence.


## Local reference docs

- Prefer local project documentation over network lookups. Do not `curl` upstream docs unless the local docs are missing or clearly insufficient.
- Start with `docs/tools/README.md` for library documentation signposts. Relevant local docs include:
  - `docs/tools/commanded/README.md` for Commanded.
  - `docs/tools/commanded-eventstore-adapter/README.md` for the EventStore adapter.
  - `docs/tools/eventstore/README.md` for EventStore.
  - `docs/tools/commanded-ecto-projections/README.md` for projections.
  - `docs/tools/cucumber/README.md` for Elixir Cucumber.
  - `docs/tools/ecto/README.md` and `docs/tools/ecto-sql/README.md` for Ecto.
  - `docs/tools/phoenix/README.md` and related Phoenix docs for web framework work.
- If you need examples, search the local `web/deps/` source tree and `docs/tools/` before using the network.

## Binding rules

- `plan.md` remains the source of truth. `todo.md` is derived execution state.
- You may split the selected task into smaller unchecked tasks, add required technical subtasks, or reorder pending tasks only to satisfy the approved plan.
- If the selected task is too large, split it in `todo.md`, leave the parent/current task unchecked or replace it with smaller unchecked tasks, then implement and check off only the first newly available slice.
- You may not delete, weaken, or silently defer plan-required work.
- Before editing, read every ADR explicitly referenced by the plan and inspect nearby/current ADRs under `docs/adr/` when relevant.
- Treat accepted ADRs as binding architecture constraints.
- Use test-driven development for behaviour changes.
- Add or update automated tests proving the selected task's behaviour/configuration.
- Run focused validation appropriate to the selected task and capture the commands/results in your response.
- Never edit acceptance feature files (`*.feature`, including files under `acceptance-tests/`). If a feature file appears wrong, stale, or insufficient, stop and report the issue.
- Add acceptance step definitions only where the plan explicitly requires executable plumbing for locked shared feature files.
- Use Req for HTTP requests; do not introduce HTTPoison, Tesla, or `:httpc`.
- Follow relevant project guidance for Phoenix, LiveView, HEEx, Tailwind, Ecto, Elixir, Mix, and tests.
- If you hit a real blocker, stop and report it clearly without checking off the task.

When finished, summarize:

1. Selected todo line and task text.
2. Code/config/test/doc changes made for this task only.
3. Focused validation commands run and results.
4. The exact todo check-off you made.
5. Any todo splits/additions/reordering and why they still satisfy the plan.
6. ADR conformance evidence for this task.
