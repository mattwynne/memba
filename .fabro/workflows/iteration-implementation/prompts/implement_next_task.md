Implement the next unchecked iteration task from `todo.md`.

Plan path: `{{ inputs.plan_path }}`.
Todo path is derived from the plan path by replacing `/plan.md` with `/todo.md`.

## Ownership rules

- Read the plan and `todo.md` before editing.
- Pick the first unchecked Markdown task line in `todo.md` (`- [ ] ...`). That task is yours from selection through check-off.
- Treat earlier checked todo lines as durable completed work. Do not redo them.
- Inspect recent Fabro checkpoint commits with `git log --oneline --decorate -20` and use their subjects/bodies/diffs as context for what previous runs already completed.
- Inspect `git status --short` before editing. The resume gate should normally guarantee a clean tree; if uncommitted changes are present, stop for human input unless they are clearly the selected task's in-progress work and you can safely continue it to completion without overwriting it.
- Never silently overwrite, discard, or duplicate uncommitted work for an unchecked task.
- Implement exactly the selected task only. Do not opportunistically implement later tasks unless the selected task cannot be completed without splitting/reordering the todo list first.
- When the implementation and focused validation are complete, check off the same task line you implemented by changing that one line from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`.
- Do not check off any other ordinary todo line.
- Do not commit manually. Fabro will checkpoint your changes automatically after this node; independent validation will inspect that checkpoint evidence.


## Local reference docs

- Prefer local project documentation over network lookups. Do not `curl` upstream docs unless the local docs are missing or clearly insufficient.
- Start with `docs/tools/README.md` for library documentation signposts. Relevant local docs include:
  - `docs/tools/commanded/README.md` for Commanded.
  - `docs/tools/commanded-eventstore-adapter/README.md` for the EventStore adapter.
  - `docs/tools/eventstore/README.md` for EventStore.
  - `docs/tools/commanded-ecto-projections/README.md` for projections.
  - `docs/tools/cucumber/README.md` for Elixir Cucumber.
  - `docs/tools/ecto/README.md` and `docs/tools/ecto-sql/README.md` for Ecto.
  - `docs/tools/phoenix/README.md` and related Phoenix docs for web framework work.
- If you need examples, search the local `web/deps/` source tree and `docs/tools/` before using the network.

## Binding rules

- `plan.md` remains the source of truth. `todo.md` is derived execution state.
- You may split the selected task into smaller unchecked tasks, add required technical subtasks, or reorder pending tasks only to satisfy the approved plan.
- If the selected task is too large, split it in `todo.md`, leave the parent/current task unchecked or replace it with smaller unchecked tasks, then implement and check off only the first newly available slice.
- You may not delete, weaken, or silently defer plan-required work.
- Before editing, read every ADR explicitly referenced by the plan and inspect nearby/current ADRs under `docs/adr/` when relevant.
- Treat accepted ADRs as binding architecture constraints.
- Use test-driven development for behaviour changes.
- Add or update automated tests proving the selected task's behaviour/configuration.
- Run focused validation appropriate to the selected task and capture the commands/results in your response.
- Never edit acceptance feature files (`*.feature`, including files under `acceptance-tests/`). If a feature file appears wrong, stale, or insufficient, stop and report the issue.
- Add acceptance step definitions only where the plan explicitly requires executable plumbing for locked shared feature files.
- Use Req for HTTP requests; do not introduce HTTPoison, Tesla, or `:httpc`.
- Follow relevant project guidance for Phoenix, LiveView, HEEx, Tailwind, Ecto, Elixir, Mix, and tests.
- If you hit a real blocker, stop and report it clearly without checking off the task.

When finished, summarize:

1. Selected todo line and task text.
2. Code/config/test/doc changes made for this task only.
3. Focused validation commands run and results.
4. The exact todo check-off you made.
5. Any todo splits/additions/reordering and why they still satisfy the plan.
6. ADR conformance evidence for this task.
