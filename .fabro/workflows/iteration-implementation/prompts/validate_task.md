Independently review the candidate task for `{{ inputs.plan_path }}`. Do not edit files.

Decide from live repository state, not from summarized context alone. Read the plan and its `todo.md`, inspect `git status --short`, working-tree/staged diffs, recent Fabro checkpoint commits and the relevant changed files. The candidate is the first unchecked task, identified in the preceding implementation or revision summary. It must remain unchecked until accepted. If the task identity or state is ambiguous, return `blocked` rather than approving a different task.

Fabro checkpoints candidate work after every node. A clean working tree means work may already be saved, not that it is accepted or absent. Review the full candidate, including earlier attempts and the latest revision; do not restrict review to the last checkpoint's diff. On revision, check the previous review's gaps as well as regressions introduced by the correction.

## Acceptance criteria

Accept only if all are true:

- The first pending task has concrete code/config/test/documentation evidence appropriate to its scope; a todo-only change is not implementation.
- The work satisfies the approved plan and relevant accepted ADRs.
- Any todo splits/additions/reordering preserve required scope, and the candidate is the first resulting pending slice. No required work was deleted, weakened, checked off prematurely or silently deferred.
- Relevant automated tests were added/updated and focused validation passed. A reported blocker is evidence for revision or escalation, not acceptance.
- Ordinary browser-facing tasks have focused browser/component/JS/CSS evidence appropriate to the change; do not require a duplicate full `dev check` solely because the task changes UI, routing, or acceptance support. The deterministic final gate still must pass before publication. If this task explicitly requires a full final-validation run, require its successful exit evidence before accepting the task; passing scenario counts without a final exit status do not prove the gate passed.
- Acceptance feature files (`*.feature`, including under `acceptance-tests/`) were not edited unless the plan's `## Allowed acceptance feature changes` section names the exact file and allowed kind of change. Any permitted edit stays within that permission and preserves the promised coverage.
- The task is a small, independently useful slice with a checkpoint evidence trail.

## Verdict

Return one JSON object matching the supplied schema, with exactly these fields:

- `decision`: `accept`, `revise`, or `blocked`.
- `task`: the exact selected unchecked todo line, including its `- [ ]` prefix and task text.
- `reason`: concise evidence from files, tests and plan/ADR constraints. For `revise`, include the specific remaining gaps and actionable corrections. For `blocked`, state the actual blocker or question.

Choose `revise` when the candidate has gaps but the task remains clear and safe to correct. Revision preserves the candidate and returns it to the implementor; it is not a validator execution failure. Choose `blocked` for ambiguity, unsafe work, a required decision/tooling fix, or repeated non-transient lack of progress. The workflow separately enforces an iteration-wide revision limit; do not invent a per-task retry allowance.

Do not emit Markdown around the JSON, routing fields, node IDs or an `outcome`. The workflow applies the verdict and checks off only an accepted task. Provider errors, timeouts and invalid output are execution failures handled by Fabro, not task verdicts.
