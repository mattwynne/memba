Prepare the final review summary for {{ inputs.plan_path }}.

Use the plan text, dev check output, implementation evidence, independent reviews, review synthesis, optional code-health recording, final artifact gate evidence, and publish step output. Do not edit files.

Critical requirements:

- Cite the final artifact gate output to confirm the reviewed implementation evidence.
- Do not claim files were changed unless they appear in the final artifact gate evidence.
- If review repairs were applied, list only files shown in final artifact evidence.
- If `docs/code-health.md` was updated, use the exact `Code-health changes recorded during this review` diff from the final artifact gate. Summarize only the finding headings and dispositions shown there; do not substitute findings from an earlier synthesis or reviewer response.
- If reviewer or synthesis findings were not fixed and not recorded in `docs/code-health.md`, call that out explicitly as a workflow failure/gap rather than presenting the run as fully handled.
- Summarize every substantive review finding as fixed, recorded, dismissed with reason, or still unhandled.
- Do not invent, assume, or hallucinate changed files that are not present in the artifact evidence.

Return:

- Result: REVIEW_ACCEPTED
- Plan path
- Base sha and reviewed commit range
- ADR conformance summary from independent reviews/synthesis
- Independent review outcome
- Finding disposition: fixed / recorded / dismissed / unhandled
- Any repairs applied during review
- Code-health note status
- Key files reviewed or repaired, matching final artifact gate evidence
- Publish outcome: whether review polish was pushed to main or main was left unchanged
- Tests and validation run
- Any manual demo/checks still recommended
- Any non-blocking follow-ups
