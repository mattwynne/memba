# Implementation TODO

- [x] 001 Add outbound message-id support: generate Memba-controlled RFC `Message-ID` values for outbound club/reply emails and persist a mapping from message id to Memba message/conversation/club. Likely touchpoints: `Memba.Messaging.MemberMessageEmail`, provider adapters, `EmailDeliveryRequest`, and a projection/table or fields that make lookup deterministic.
- [x] 002 Set reply email headers: club/reply emails should route normal replies to `<club-slug>@clubs.memba.io`; reply notification emails should set `In-Reply-To` / `References` so email clients thread and Memba can recognize the conversation on inbound.
- [x] 003 Extend inbound parsing: parse `In-Reply-To` and all `References` message ids in Postmark/Resend provider-neutral inbound structs. Likely touchpoints: `MembaWeb.PostmarkInboundEmailParser`, `MembaWeb.ResendInboundEmailParser`, and `Memba.Messaging.InboundEmail`.
- [x] 004 Extend inbound routing: before creating a new club-wide message, attempt a same-club header match; when found, post via the 039 reply path, apply current-member authorization, auto-follow the replier, fan out to followers, and apply basic quoted-history stripping.
- [x] 005 Preserve and test fallback behaviour: no same-club header match remains the existing club-wide inbound message path; non-members, ambiguous senders, unsupported bodies/attachments, unknown clubs, and malformed provider payloads keep using existing rejection behaviour.
- [x] 006 Make the `@iteration-041` scenarios executable; remove/narrow `@todo-*`.
- [ ] 007 Run `dev check`.
